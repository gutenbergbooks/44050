<p class="p1">DIVINE EPIGRAMS.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>These verses were rescued from oblivion by Mr Malone, having
escaped the notice of Dryden's former editors. I have disposed
them among the Epistles, that being the title which the author
seems usually to have given to those copies of verses, which
he sent to his friends upon their publications, and which, according
to the custom of the time, were prefixed to the works to which
they related. They form the second of our author's attempts
at poetry hitherto discovered, the "Elegy upon Lord Hastings"
being the first. The lines are distinguished by the hard and rugged
versification, and strained conceit, which characterised English poetry
before the Restoration. The title of Hoddesdon's book is a
sufficiently odd one: "Sion and Parnassus, or Epigrams on several
Texts of the Old and New Testaments," 8vo, 1650. Dryden
was then a student in Trinity College, Cambridge, and about
eighteen years old. The nature of the volume which called forth
his poetical approbation, may lead us to suppose, that, at this time,
he retained the puritanical principles in which he was doubtless
educated. The verses are subscribed, <cite>J. Dryden of Trin. C.</cite></p>

<h2><a name="EPISTLE_THE_SECOND" id="EPISTLE_THE_SECOND">EPISTLE THE SECOND.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">TO MY HONOURED FRIEND</p>

<p class="p3">SIR ROBERT HOWARD,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS</p>

<p class="p1">EXCELLENT POEMS.</p>
<hr class="r15" />

<p>This epistle was prefixed to Sir Robert Howard's poems, printed
for Herringman, 12mo, 1660, and entered in the Stationers'
books on 16th April that year. It was probably written about
the commencement of Dryden's intimacy with the author, whose
sister he afterwards married. Sir Robert Howard, son to the Earl
of Berkshire, a man of quality, a wit, and a cavalier, was able to
extend effectual patronage to a rising author; and so willing to do
it, that he is even said to have received Dryden into his own house.
These lines, therefore, make part of Dryden's grateful acknowledgments,
of which more may be found in the prefatory letter to the
"Annus Mirabilis," addressed to Sir Robert Howard.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
friendship of the brother poets was afterwards suspended for some
time, in consequence of Sir Robert's strictures on the "Essay on
Dramatic Poetry," and Dryden's contemptuous refutation of his
criticism. But there is reason to believe, that this interval of coldness
was of short duration; and that, if the warmth of their original
intimacy was never renewed, they resumed the usual kindly
intercourse of relations and friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The epistle itself is earlier in date than the poem called "Astrea
Redux," which was probably not published till the summer of 1660
was somewhat advanced. This copy of verses, therefore, is the first
avowed production of our author after the Restoration, and may
rank, in place and merit, with "Astrea Redux," the "Poem on the
Coronation," and the "Address to the Chancellor." There is the
same anxiety to turn and point every sentence, and the same tendency
to extravagant and unnatural conceit. Yet it is sometimes
difficult to avoid admiring the strength of the author's mind, even
when employed in wresting ideas the wrong way. It is remarkable,
also, that Dryden ventures to praise the verses of his patron,
on account of that absence of extravagant metaphor, and that
sobriety of poetic composition, for which, to judge by his own
immediate practice, he ought rather to have censured them.</p>

<p>Those who may be induced to peruse the works of Sir Robert
Howard, by the high commendation here bestowed upon them,
will have more reason to praise the gratitude of our author, than
the justice of his panegyric. They are productions of a most freezing
mediocrity.</p>

<h2><a name="EPISTLE_THE_THIRD" id="EPISTLE_THE_THIRD">EPISTLE THE THIRD.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">TO MY HONOURED FRIEND</p>

<p class="p3">DR CHARLETON,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS</p>

<p class="p1">LEARNED AND USEFUL WORKS,</p>

<p class="p2">BUT MORE PARTICULARLY HIS TREATISE OF STONEHENGE,</p>

<p class="p2">BY HIM RESTORED TO THE TRUE</p>

<p class="p2">FOUNDER.</p>

<hr class="ra5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Walter Charleton</span>, M.D. was born in 1619, and educated
at Oxford to the profession of physic, in which he became very
eminent. During the residence of King Charles I. at Oxford, in
the civil wars, Charleton became one of the physicians in ordinary
to his majesty. He afterwards settled in London; and, having a
strong bent towards philosophical and historical investigation, became
intimate with the most learned and liberal of his profession,
particularly with Ent and Harvey. He wrote several treatises in
the dark period preceding the Restoration, when, the government
being in the hands of swordsmen equally ignorant and fanatical,
a less ardent mind would have been discouraged from investigations,
attended neither by fame nor profit. These essays
were upon physical, philosophical, and moral subjects. After the
Restoration, Charleton published the work upon which he is here
congratulated by our author. Its full title is, "<span class="smcap">Chorea Gigantum</span>,
or the most famous antiquity of Great Britain, <span class="smcap">Stonehenge</span>,
standing on Salisbury Plain, restored to the Danes. By Walter
Charleton, M.D., and Physician in Ordinary to his Majesty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
London, 1663, 4to." The opinion which Dr Charleton had formed
concerning the origin of this stupendous monument is strengthened
by the information which he received from the famous northern
antiquary, Olaus Wormius. But it is nevertheless hypothetical,
and inconsistent with evidence; for Stonehenge is expressly
mentioned by Nennius, who wrote two hundred years before
the arrival of the Danes in Britain. If it be true, which is alleged
by some writers, that it was anciently called Stan-Hengist, or,
indeed, whether that be true or no, the monument seems likely
to have been a Saxon erection, during their days of paganism;
for it is neither mentioned by Cæsar nor Tacitus, who were both
likely to have noticed a structure of so remarkable an appearance.
Leaving the book to return to the author, I am sorry to add, that
this learned man, after being president of the College of Physicians,
and thus having attained the highest honours of his profession, in
1691 fell into embarrassed circumstances, which forced him shortly
after to take refuge in the island of Jersey. It is uncertain if
Dr Charleton ever returned from this sort of exile; but his death
took place in 1707, at the advanced age of eighty-eight years.</p>

<p>Dr Charleton's hypothesis concerning Stonehenge was but indifferently
received. It was considered as a personal attack on
Inigo Jones, who had formed a much more fantastic opinion upon
the subject, conceiving the stones to form a temple, dedicated, by
the Romans, to the god Cælus, or Cælum. To the disgrace
of that great architect's accuracy, it seems probable that he never
had seen the monument which he attempts to describe; for he has
converted an irregular polygon into a regular hexagon, in order to
suit his own system. Dryden sided with Charleton in his theory;
and, in the following elegant epistle, compliments him as having
discovered the long-forgotten cause of this strange monument.
The verses are not only valuable for the poetry and numbers, but
for the accurate and interesting account which they present of the
learning and philosophers of the age. It was probably written soon
before the publication of Charleton's book in 1663. Sir Robert
Howard also favoured Dr Charleton with a copy of recommendatory
verses. Both poems are prefixed to the second edition of the
"Chorea Gigantum," which is the only one I have seen. That of
Dryden seems to have been afterwards revised and corrected.</p>

<p class="p2">TO THE</p>

<p class="p3">LADY CASTLEMAIN,</p>

<p class="p2">UPON HER ENCOURAGING HIS FIRST PLAY,</p>

<p class="p1">THE WILD GALLANT,</p>

<p class="p2">ACTED IN 1662-3.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Barbara Villiers, heiress of William Viscount Grandison, in Ireland, and
wife of Roger Palmer, Esq., was the first favourite, who after the
Restoration of Charles II. enjoyed the power and consequence of a royal
mistress. It is even said, that the king took her from her husband, upon
the very day of his landing, and raised him, in compensation, to the
rank and title of Earl of Castlemain. The lady herself was created Lady
Nonsuch, Countess of Southampton, and finally Duchess of Cleveland. She
bore the king three sons and three daughters, and long enjoyed a
considerable share of his favour.</p>

<p>It would seem, that, in 1662-3, while Lady Castlemain was in the very
height of her reign, she extended her patronage to our author, upon his
commencing his dramatic career. In the preface to his first play, "The
Wild Gallant," he acknowledges, that it met with very indifferent
success, and had been condemned by the greater part of the audience. But
he adds, "it was well received at court, and was more than once the
divertisement of his majesty by his own command."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> These marks of
royal favour were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> doubtless owing to the intercession of Lady
Castlemain. If we can trust the sarcasm thrown out by a contemporary
satirist, our author piqued himself more on this light and gallant
effusion, than its importance deserved.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The verses abound with
sprightly and ingenious turns; and the conceits, which were the taste of
the age, shew to some advantage on such an occasion. There is, however,
little propriety in comparing the influence of the royal mistress to the
virtue of Cato.</p>

  <span class="i0">When first the triumphs of your sex were sung</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By those old poets, beauty was but young,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And few admired the native red and white,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till poets dressed them up to charm the sight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So beauty took on trust, and did engage</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sums of praises till she came to age.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But this long-growing debt to poetry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You justly, madam, have discharged to me,</span><br />

<h2><a name="EPISTLE_THE_FIFTH" id="EPISTLE_THE_FIFTH">EPISTLE THE FIFTH.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p3">MR LEE,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS TRAGEDY OF</p>

<p class="p1">THE RIVAL QUEENS, OR ALEXANDER THE GREAT.</p>

<p class="p2">1677.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p>"The Rival Queens, or Alexander the Great," of Nathaniel
Lee, has been always deemed the most capital performance of
its unfortunate author. There is nothing throughout the play
that is tame or indifferent; all is either exquisitely good, or extravagantly
bombastic, though some passages hover between the sublime
and the ludicrous. Addison has justly remarked, that Lee's
"thoughts are wonderfully suited for tragedy, but frequently lost
in such a crowd of words, that it is hard to see the beauty of them.
There is infinite fire in his works, but so involved in smoke, that it
does not appear in half its lustre."</p>

<p>Lee and our author lived on terms of strict friendship, and wrote,
in conjunction, "&#338;dipus," and the "Duke of Guise." Lee's madness
and confinement in Bedlam are well known; as also his repartee
to a coxcomb, who told him, it was easy to write like a
madman:&mdash;"No," answered the poet, "it is not easy to write like
a madman, but it is very easy to write like a fool." Dryden elegantly
apologizes, in the following verses, for the extravagance of
his style of poetry. Lee's death was very melancholy: Being discharged
from Bedlam, and returning by night from a tavern, in a
state of intoxication, to his lodgings in Duke-street, he fell down
somewhere in Clare-Market, and was either killed by a carriage
driving over him, or stifled in the snow, which was then deep.
Thus died this eminent dramatic poet in the year 1691, or 1692,
in the 35th year of his age.</p>

<p class="p2">TO THE</p>

<p class="p3">EARL OF ROSCOMMON,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS EXCELLENT</p>

<p class="p1">ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE.</p>
<hr class="r15" />


<p>The Earl of Roscommon's "Essay on Translated Verse," a
work which abounds with much excellent criticism, expressed in
correct, succinct, and manly language, was first published in 4to,
in 1680: a second edition, corrected and enlarged, appeared in
1684. To both editions are prefixed the following copy of verses
by our author; and to the second there is also one in Latin by his
son Charles Dryden, afterwards translated by Mr Needler.</p>

<p>The high applause which our author has here and elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> bestowed
on the "Essay on Translated Verse," is censured by Dr
Johnson, as unmerited and exaggerated. But while something is
allowed for the partiality of a friend, and the zeal of a panegyrist,
it must also be remembered, that the rules of criticism, now so
well known as to be even trite and hackneyed, were then almost
new to the literary world, and that translation was but then
beginning to be emancipated from the fetters of verbal and literal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
versions. But Johnson elsewhere does Roscommon more justice,
where he acknowledges, that "he improved taste, if he did not enlarge
knowledge, and may be numbered among the benefactors of
English literature."</p>

<p>Dryden has testified, in several places of his works, that he loved
and honoured Roscommon; particularly by inscribing and applying
to him his version of the Third Ode of the First Book of Horace.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Roscommon repaid these favours by a copy of verses addressed
to Dryden on the "Religio Laici."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="p2">ON HER</p>

<p class="p2">RETURN FROM SCOTLAND, IN THE YEAR 1682.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p>These smooth and elegant lines are addressed to Mary of
Este, second wife of James Duke of York, and afterwards his
queen. She was at this time in all the splendour of beauty; tall,
and admirably formed in her person; dignified and graceful in her
deportment, her complexion very fair, and her hair and eye-brows
of the purest black. Her personal charms fully merited the encomiastic
strains of the following epistle.</p>

<p>The Duchess accompanied her husband to Scotland, where
he was sent into a kind of honorary banishment, during the dependence
of the Bill of Exclusion. Upon the dissolution of the
Oxford parliament, the Duke visited the court in triumph; and after
two months stay, returned to Scotland, and in his voyage suffered
the misfortune of shipwreck, elsewhere mentioned particularly.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Having settled the affairs of Scotland, he returned with his family
to England; whence he had been virtually banished for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
years. His return was hailed by the poets of the royal party with
unbounded congratulation. It is celebrated by Tate, in the Second
Part of "Absalom and Achitophel;"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and by our author, in a

<p class="p2">TO MY FRIEND,</p>

<p class="p3">MR J. NORTHLEIGH,</p>

<p class="p2">AUTHOR OF</p>

<p class="p1">THE PARALLEL;</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS</p>

<p class="p1">TRIUMPH OF THE BRITISH MONARCHY.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p>These verses have been recovered by Mr Malone, and are
transferred, from his life of Dryden, into the present collection of
his works. John Northleigh was by profession a student of law,
though he afterwards became a physician; and was in politics a
keen Tory. He wrote "The Parallel, or the new specious Association,
an old rebellious Covenant, closing with a disparity between
a true Patriot and a factious Associator." London, 1682,
folio. This work was anonymous; but attracted so much applause
among the High-churchmen, that, according to Wood, Dr Lawrence
Womack called the author "an excellent person, whose
name his own modesty, or prudence, as well as the iniquity of the
times, keeps from us."</p>

<p>Proceeding in the same track of politics, Northleigh published
two pamphlets on the side of the Tories, in the dispute between
the petitioners and abhorrers; and finally produced, "The Triumph
of our Monarchy, over the Plots and Principles of our
Rebels and Republicans, being remarks on their most eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Libels. London, 1685." This last publication called forth the
following lines from our author.</p>

<p>Northleigh was the son of a Hamburgh merchant, and born in
that city. He became a student in Exeter College, in 1674, aged
17 years; and was, it appears, studying law in the Inner Temple
in 1685, when his book was published. He was then, consequently,
about 28 years old; so that his genius was not peculiarly premature,
notwithstanding our author's compliment. He afterwards
took a medical degree at Cambridge, and practised physic at
Exeter.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wood</span>, <cite>Athenæ Oxon</cite>. Vol. II. p. 962.</p>

<p>These verses, like the address to Hoddesdon, are ranked among
the Epistles, because Dryden gave that title to other recommendatory
verses of the same nature.</p>

<h2><a name="EPISTLE_THE_NINTH" id="EPISTLE_THE_NINTH">EPISTLE THE NINTH.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">A</p>

<p class="p3">LETTER</p>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p1">SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p>Sir George Etherege, as a lively and witty companion, a smooth
sonnetteer, and an excellent writer of comedy, was in high reputation
in the seventeenth century. He lived on terms of intimacy
with the men of genius, and with those of rank, at the court of
Charles the Second, and appears to have been particularly acquainted
with Dryden. Etherege enjoyed in a particular manner
the favour of Queen Mary of Este, through whose influence
he was sent envoy to Hamburgh, and afterwards became resident
minister at Ratisbon. In this situation, he did not cease to interest
himself in the progress of English literature; and we have
several of his letters, both in prose and verse, written with great
wit and vivacity, to the Duke of Buckingham, and other persons
of wit and honour at the court of London. Among others, he
wrote an epistle in verse to the Earl of Middleton, who engaged
Dryden to return the following answer to it. As Sir George's
verses are lively and pleasing, I have prefixed them to Dryden's
epistle. Both pieces, with a second letter from Etherege to Middleton,
appeared in Dryden's Miscellanies.</p>

<p>Our poet's epistle to Sir George Etherege affords an example
how easily Dryden could adapt his poetry to the style which the
moment required; since, although this is the only instance in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
he has used the verse of eight syllables, it flows as easily from his
pen as if he had never written in another measure. This is the more
remarkable, as, in the "Essay on Satire," Dryden speaks very contemptuously
of the eight syllable, or Hudibrastic measure, and the
ornaments proper to it, as a little instrument, unworthy the use
of a great master.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Here, however, he happily retorts upon the
witty knight, with his own weapons of gallant and courtly ridicule,
and acquits himself, as well in the light arms of a polite and fashionable
courtier, as when he wields the trenchant brand of his own
keen satire.</p>

<p>Our author had formerly favoured Sir George Etherege with an
excellent epilogue to his popular play, called "The Man of Mode,"
acted in 1676, and he occasionally speaks of him in his writings
with great respect. The date of this epistle is not easily ascertained.
From a letter of Etherege to the Duke of Buckingham,
it appears, that Sir George was at Ratisbon when Dryden was engaged
in his controversial poetry;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> but whether that letter be
previous or subsequent to the epistle to the Earl of Middleton,
seems uncertain.</p>

<p>Considering the high reputation which Sir George Etherege
enjoyed, and the figure which he made as a courtier and a man
of letters, it is humbling to add, that we have no accurate information
concerning the time or manner of his death. It seems
certain, that he never returned from the Continent; but it is dubious,
whether, according to one report, he followed the fortunes
of King James, and resided with him at the court of St Germains till
his death, or whether, as others have said, that event was occasioned
by his falling down the stairs of his own house at Ratisbon, when,
after drinking freely with a large company, he was attempting to do
the honours of their retreat. From the date of the letter to the
Duke of Buckingham, 21st October, 1689, it is plain he was then
at Ratisbon; and it is somewhat singular, that he appears to
have retained his official situation of Resident, though nearly twelve
months had elapsed since the Revolution. This seems to give countenance
to the latter report of his having died at Ratisbon. The
date of that event was probably about 1694.</p>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">MR</span> SOUTHERNE,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS COMEDY</p>

<p class="p2">CALLED</p>

<p class="p1">THE WIVES' EXCUSE,</p>

<p class="p2">ACTED IN 1692.</p>

<hr class="r10" />


<p><span class="smcap">Southerne</span>,&mdash;well known to the present age as a tragic writer,
for his Isabella has been ranked among the first-rate parts of our
inimitable Siddons,&mdash;was also distinguished by his contemporaries
as a successful candidate for the honours of the comic muse.
Two of his comedies, "The Mother in Fashion," and "Sir Anthony
Love," had been represented with success, when, in 1692,
the "Wives' Excuse, or Cuckolds make Themselves," was brought
forward. The tone of that piece approaches what we now call
genteel comedy: but, whether owing to the flatness into which
such plays are apt to slide, for want of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis comica</i> which
enlivens the more animated, though coarser, effusions of the lower
comedy, or to some strokes of satire directed against music meetings,
and other places of fashionable resort, "The Wives' Excuse"
was unfortunate in the representation. The author, in the dedication
of the printed play,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> has hinted at the latter cause as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of his defeat; and vindicates himself from the idea of reflecting
upon music meetings, or any other resort of the people of fashion,
by urging, that although a <i xml:lang="fr">billet doux</i> is represented as being there
delivered, "such a thing has been done before now in a church,
without the place being thought the worse of." But Southerne
consoles himself for the disapprobation of the audience with the
favour of Dryden, who, says he, "speaking of this play, has publicly
said, the town was kind to 'Sir Anthony Love;' I needed
them only to be just to this." And, after mentioning that Dryden
had intrusted to him, upon the credit of this play, the task of
completing "Cleomenes,"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> he triumphantly adds,&mdash;"If modesty
be sometimes a weakness, what I say can hardly be a crime: in a
fair English trial, both parties are allowed to be heard; and without
this vanity of mentioning Mr Dryden, I had lost the best evidence
of my cause." Dryden, not satisfied with a verbal exertion
of his patronage, consoled his friend under his discomfiture,
by addressing to him the following Epistle, in which his failure is
ascribed to the taste for bustling intrigue, and for low and farcical
humour.</p>

<p>It is not the Editor's business to trace Southerne's life, or poetical
career. He was born in the county of Dublin, in 1659;
and produced, in his twenty-third year, the tragedy of "The
Loyal Brother," which Dryden honoured with a prologue. On
this occasion, Southerne's acquaintance with our bard took place,
under the whimsical circumstances mentioned Vol. X. p. 372.
The aged bard furnished also a prologue to Southerne's "Disappointment,
or Mother in Fashion;" and as he had repeatedly
ushered him to success, he presented him with the following lines
to console him under disappointment. The poets appear to have
continued on the most friendly terms until Dryden's death.
Southerne survived him many years, and lived to be praised by
the rising generation of a second century, for mildness of manners,
and that cheerful and amiable disposition, which rarely is
found in old age, unless from the happy union of a body at
ease, and a conscience void of offence. When this dramatist was
sixty-five, his last play, called "Money the Mistress," was acted,
with a prologue by Welsted, containing the following beautiful
lines:<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">HENRY HIGDEN, Esq.</span></p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS TRANSLATION OF</p>

<p class="p1">THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Higden</span> was a member of the honourable society of
the Middle Temple, and during the reigns of James II. and William
III. held some rank among the wits of the age. He wrote a
play called "Sir Noisy Parrot, or the Wary Widow," represented
in 1693, which seems to have been most effectually damned;
for in the preface the author complains, that "the theatre was
by faction transformed into a bear-garden, hissing, mimicking, ridiculing,
and cat-calling." I mention this circumstance, because
amongst the poetical friends who hastened to condole with Mr
Higden on the bad success of his piece, there is one who attributes
it to the influence of our author over the inferior wits at
Will's coffee-house.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But it seems more generally admitted, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the cause of the downfall of the "Wary Widow," that the author
being a man of a convivial temper, had introduced too great a
display of good eating and drinking into his piece; and that the
actors, although Mr Higden complains of their general negligence,
entered into these convivial scenes with great zeal, and became
finally incapable of proceeding in their parts.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The prologue was
written by Sir Charles Sedley, in which the following lines seem
to be levelled at Dryden's critical prefaces:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0sm">But against old, as well as new, to rage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Is the peculiar phrenzy of this age;</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Shakespeare must down, and you must praise no more</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Soft Desdemona, or the jealous Moor.</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Shakespeare, whose fruitful genius, happy wit,</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Was framed and finished at a lucky hit;</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">The pride of nature, and the shame of schools,</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Born to create, and not to learn from rules,</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Must please no more. His bastards now deride</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Their father's nakedness, they ought to hide;</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">But when on spurs their Pegasus they force,</span><br />
  <span class="i0sm">Their jaded muse is distanced in the course.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the admirers of Dryden were active in the condemnation of
Higden's play, the offence probably lay in these verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems likely that Higden's translation, of the Tenth Satire
of Juvenal, which I have never seen, was printed before Dryden
published his own version, in 1693; consequently, before the damnation
of the "Wary Widow," acted in the same year, which
seems to have been attended with a quarrel between Dryden and
the author. It is therefore very probable, that this Epistle should
have stood earlier in the arrangement: but, having no positive evidence,
the Editor has not disturbed the former order.</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS COMEDY</p>

<p class="p2">CALLED</p>

<p class="p1">THE DOUBLE DEALER.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p>This admirable Epistle is addressed to Congreve, whose rising
genius had early attracted our author's attention and patronage.
When Congreve was about to bring out "The Old Bachelor,"
the manuscript was put by Southerne into Dryden's hands, who
declared, that he had never seen such a first play, and bestowed
considerable pains in adapting it to the stage. It was received
with the most unbounded approbation. "The Double Dealer"
was acted in November 1693, but without that universal applause
which attended "The Old Bachelor." The plot was perhaps
too serious, and the villainy of Maskwell too black and
hateful for comedy. It was the opinion too of Dryden, that the
fashionable world felt the satire too keenly.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The play, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
cannot be said to have failed; for it rose by degrees against
opposition. The epistle is one of the most elegant and apparently
heart-felt effusions of friendship, that our language boasts;
and the progress of literature from the Restoration, is described
as Dryden alone could describe it. A critic of that day, whose
candour seems to have been on a level with his taste, has ventured
to insinuate, that <em>huffing Dryden</em>, as he prophanely calls
our poet, had purposely deluded Congreve into presumption, by
his praise, in order that he might lead him to make shipwreck of
his popularity. But such malevolent constructions have been always
put upon the conduct of men of genius, by the mean jealousy
of the vulgar.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>George Granville, afterwards Lord Lansdowne of Biddiford,
was distinguished, by the friendship of Dryden and Pope,
from the mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease. He copied Waller,
a model perhaps chosen from a judicious consideration of his
own powers. His best piece is his "Essay on unnatural Flights
in Poetry," in which he elegantly apologizes for Dryden having suffered
his judgment to be swayed by a wild audience. Granville's
play of the "Heroic Love, or the cruel Separation," was acted in
1698 with great applause. It is a mythological drama on the love
of Agamemnon and Briseis; and this being said, it is hardly necessary
to add, that it now scarcely bears reading. Granville's unshaken
attachment to Tory principles, as well as his excellent private
character, probably gained him favour in our poet's eyes.
Lord Lansdowne (for such became Granville's title when Queen
Anne created twelve peers to secure a majority to ministry in the
House of Lords) died on the 30th January, 1735.</p>

<p class="p2">TO MY FRIEND</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="smcap">Mr MOTTEUX</span>,</p>

<p class="p2">ON HIS TRAGEDY</p>

<p class="p2">CALLED</p>

<p class="p1">BEAUTY IN DISTRESS,</p>

<p class="p2">PUBLISHED IN 1698.</p>

<hr class="r10" />


<p>Peter Anthony Motteux was a French Huguenot, born
at Rohan, in Normandy, in l660. He emigrated upon the revocation
of the edict of Nantz; and having friends in England of
opulence and respectability, he became a merchant and bookseller
of some eminence; besides enjoying a place in the Post-office, to
which his skill as a linguist recommended him. This must have
been considerable, if we judge by his proficiency in the language
of England, certainly not the most easy to be commanded by a
foreigner. Nevertheless, Motteux understood it so completely, as
not only to write many occasional pieces of English poetry, but to
execute a very good translation of "Don Quixote," and compose
no less than fifteen plays, several of which were very well received.
He also conducted the "Gentleman's Journal." On the 19th February,
1717-18, this author was found dead in a house of bad
fame, in the parish of St Clement Danes, not without suspicion of
murder.</p>

<p>Motteux appears to have enjoyed the countenance of Dryden,
who, in the following verses, consoles him under the censure of
those who imputed to his play of "Beauty in Distress" an irregularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of plot, and complication of incident. But the preliminary
and more important part of the verses regards Jeremy Collier's
violent attack upon the dramatic authors of the age for immorality
and indecency. To this charge, our author, on this as on
other occasions, seems to plead guilty, while he deprecates the virulence,
and sometimes unfair severity of his adversary. The
reader may compare the poetical defence here set up with that in
the prose dedication to the "Fables," and he will find in both the
same grumbling, though subdued, acquiescence under the chastisement
of the moralist; the poet much resembling an over-matched
general, who is unwilling to surrender, though conscious
of his inability to make an effectual resistance. See also Vol. VIII.

<h2><a name="EPISTLE_THE_FIFTEENTH" id="EPISTLE_THE_FIFTEENTH">EPISTLE THE FIFTEENTH.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">TO MY HONOURED KINSMAN</p>

<p class="p3">JOHN DRIDEN,</p>

<p class="p2">OF</p>

<p class="p2">CHESTERTON, IN THE COUNTY OF</p>

<p class="p2">HUNTINGDON, ESQ.</p>

<hr class="ra5" />


<p>The person to whom this epistle is addressed was Dryden's
first cousin; being the second son of Sir John Driden, elder brother
of the poet's father Erasmus. He derived from his maternal
grandfather, Sir Robert Bevile, the valuable estate of Chesterton,
near Stilton, where latterly our author frequently visited him, and
where it is said he wrote the first four verses of his Virgil with a
diamond on a glass pane. The mansion-house is at this time
(spring, 1807,) about to be pulled down, and the materials sold.
The life of Mr John Driden, for he retained the ancient spelling of
the name, seems to have been that of an opulent and respectable
country gentleman, more happy, perhaps, in the quiet enjoyment of
a large landed property, than his cousin in possession of his brilliant
poetical genius. He represented the county of Huntingdon in
parliament, in 1690, and from 1700 till his death in 1707-8.</p>

<p>The panegyric of our author is an instance, among a thousand,
how genius can gild what it touches; for the praise of this lofty
rhyme, when minutely examined, details the qualities of that very
ordinary, though very useful and respectable, character, a wealthy
and sensible country squire. "Just, good, and wise," contending
neighbours referred their disputes to his decision; in humble
prose, he was an active justice of peace. That he was hospitable,
and kept a good pack of hounds, was a fox-hunter while young, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
now followed beagles or harriers, that he represented his county,
and voted against ministry, sums up his excellencies; for I will
not follow my author, by numbering among them his living and
dying a bachelor.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Yet these annals, however simple and vulgar,
illuminated by the touch of our author's pen, shine like the
clouds under the influence of a setting sun. The greatest illustration
of our author's genius is, that the praise, though unusually
applied, is appropriate, and hardly exaggerated; we lay down the
book, and recollect to how little this laboured character amounts;
and when we resume it, are again hurried away by the magic of
the poet. But in this epistle, besides the compliment to his cousin,
Dryden had a further intention in view, which was, to illustrate
the character of a good English member of Parliament, whom,
in conformity with his own prejudice, he represents as inclining to
oppose the ministry. It was coincidence in this sentiment which
had done much to reconcile Dryden and his cousin; and thus politics
reunited relations, whom political disputes had long parted.
At this time we learn from one of our author's letters, that Mr
Dryden of Chesterton, although upon different principles, was in
as warm opposition as his cousin could have wished him.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Our
poet, however, who had felt the hand of power, did not venture
on this portrait without such an explanation to Charles Montague,
afterwards Lord Halifax, as he thought sufficient to avert any risk
of misconstruction.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>There has not been found any early edition of this epistle separate
from the volume of Fables; of which therefore it probably
made an original part, and was first published with them in 1700.
It supplies one instance among many, that the poet's lamp burned
clear to the close of life. It is said that his cousin acknowledged
the honour done him by the poet, by a handsome gratuity. The
amount has been alleged to be five hundred pounds, which is probably
exaggerated. Mr Driden of Chesterton bequeathed that
sum to Charles Dryden, the poet's son, who did not live to profit
by the legacy. As the report of the present to Dryden himself
depends only on tradition,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> it is possible the two circumstances
may have been more or less confounded together.</p>

<p>The reader may be pleased to see the epitaph of John Driden
of Chesterton, which concludes with some lines from this epistle.
It is in the church of the village of Chesterton:</p>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p3">SIR GODFREY KNELLER.</p>

<p class="p2">PRINCIPAL PAINTER TO</p>

<p class="p1">HIS MAJESTY.</p>

<hr class="ra5" />


<p>The well-known Sir Godfrey Kneller was a native of Lubec,
but settled in London about 1674. He was a man of genius; but,
according to Walpole, he lessened his reputation, by making it
subservient to his fortune. No painter was more distinguished by
the great, for ten sovereigns sate to him. What may tend longer
to preserve his reputation, no painter ever received more incense
from the praise of poets. Dryden, Pope, Addison, Prior, Tickell,
Steele, all wrote verses to him in the tone of extravagant eulogy.
Those addressed to Kneller by Addison, in which the series of the
heathen deities is, with unexampled happiness, made to correspond
with that of the British monarchs painted by the artist, are
not only the best production of that elegant poet, but of their
kind the most felicitous ever written. Sir Godfrey Kneller died
27th November, 1723.</p>

<p>Dryden seems to have addressed the following epistle to Sir
Godfrey Kneller, as an acknowledgment for the copy of the Chandos'
portrait of Shakespeare, mentioned in the verses. It would
appear that, upon other occasions, Sir Godfrey repaid the tributes
of the poets, by the productions of his pencil.</p>

<p>There is great luxuriance and richness of idea and imagery in
the epistle.</p>

<h3>EPISTLE THE SIXTEENTH.</h3>

<hr class="r15" />

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">O</span> <span class="smcap">&nbsp;nce</span> I beheld the fairest of her kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And still the sweet idea charms my mind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">True, she was dumb; for nature gazed so long,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pleased with her work, that she forgot her tongue;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, smiling, said&mdash;She still shall gain the prize;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I only have transferred it to her eyes.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such are thy pictures, Kneller, such thy skill,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That nature seems obedient to thy will;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Comes out, and meets thy pencil in the draught,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lives there, and wants but words to speak her thought.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At least thy pictures look a voice; and we</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Imagine sounds, deceived to that degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We think 'tis somewhat more than just to see.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Shadows are but privations of the light;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet, when we walk, they shoot before the sight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With us approach, retire, arise, and fall;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nothing themselves, and yet expressing all.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such are thy pieces, imitating life</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So near, they almost conquer in the strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from their animated canvas came,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Demanding souls, and loosened from the frame.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Prometheus, were he here, would cast away</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His Adam, and refuse a soul to clay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And either would thy noble work inspire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or think it warm enough, without his fire.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">But vulgar hands may vulgar likeness raise;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This is the least attendant on thy praise:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From hence the rudiments of art began;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A coal, or chalk, first imitated man:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Perhaps the shadow, taken on a wall,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Gave outlines to the rude original;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ere canvas yet was strained, before the grace</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of blended colours found their use and place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or cypress tablets first received a face.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">By slow degrees the godlike art advanced;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As man grew polished, picture was enhanced:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Greece added posture, shade, and perspective,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And then the mimic piece began to live.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet perspective was lame, no distance true,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all came forward in one common view:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No point of light was known, no bounds of art;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When light was there, it knew not to depart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But glaring on remoter objects played;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not languished and insensibly decayed.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i1">Rome raised not art, but barely kept alive,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with old Greece unequally did strive;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till Goths and Vandals, a rude northern race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Did all the matchless monuments deface.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then all the Muses in one ruin lie,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And rhyme began to enervate poetry.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Thus, in a stupid military state,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The pen and pencil find an equal fate.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Flat faces, such as would disgrace a skreen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as in Bantam's embassy were seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unraised, unrounded, were the rude delight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of brutal nations, only born to fight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Long time the sister arts, in iron sleep,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A heavy sabbath did supinely keep;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length, in Raphael's age, at once they rise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stretch all their limbs, and open all their eyes.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thence rose the Roman, and the Lombard line;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One coloured best, and one did best design.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Raphael's, like Homer's, was the nobler part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Titian's painting looked like Virgil's art.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thy genius gives thee both; where true design,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Postures unforced, and lively colours join,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Likeness is ever there; but still the best,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Like proper thoughts in lofty language drest,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where light, to shades descending, plays, not strives,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dies by degrees, and by degrees revives.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of various parts a perfect whole is wrought;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy pictures think, and we divine their thought.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Shakespeare, thy gift, I place before my sight;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">With awe, I ask his blessing ere I write;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With reverence look on his majestic face;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proud to be less, but of his godlike race.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">His soul inspires me, while thy praise I write,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And I, like Teucer, under Ajax fight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bids thee, through me, be bold; with dauntless breast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Contemn the bad, and emulate the best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like his, thy critics in the attempt are lost;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When most they rail, know then, they envy most.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In vain they snarl aloof; a noisy crowd,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like women's anger, impotent and loud.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While they their barren industry deplore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pass on secure, and mind the goal before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Old as she is, my muse shall march behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bear off the blast, and intercept the wind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Our arts are sisters, though not twins in birth,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For hymns were sung in Eden's happy earth:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But oh, the painter muse, though last in place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Has seized the blessing first, like Jacob's race.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Apelles' art an Alexander found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Raphael did with Leo's gold abound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But Homer was with barren laurel crowned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou hadst thy Charles a while, and so had I;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But pass we that unpleasing image by.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rich in thyself, and of thyself divine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All pilgrims come and offer at thy shrine.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A graceful truth thy pencil can command;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fair themselves go mended from thy hand.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Likeness appears in every lineament,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But likeness in thy work is eloquent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though nature there her true resemblance bears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A nobler beauty in thy piece appears.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So warm thy work, so glows the generous frame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Flesh looks less living in the lovely dame.</span><br />

<h3>UPON THE DEATH OF LORD HASTINGS.</h3>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The subject of this elegy was Henry Lord Hastings, eldest son
of Ferdinando Earl of Huntingdon. He was born 16th January,
1630, and died 24th June, 1649. He was buried at Ashby de la
Zouche, near the superb family-seat of Donnington-Castle. This
Lord Hastings, says Collins, was a nobleman of great learning,
and of so sweet a disposition, that no less than ninety-eight
elegies were made on him, and published in 1650, under this
title: "<cite>Lachrymæ Musarum</cite>, the Tears of the Muses expressed
in Elegies written by divers Persons of nobility and worth, upon
the Death of the most hopeful Henry, Lord Hastings, eldest
son of the Right Honourable Ferdinando, Earl of Huntingdon,
then general of the high-born Prince George, Duke of Clarence,
brother to King Edward IV."</p>

<p>This accomplished young nobleman died unmarried; but, from
the concluding lines of the elegy, it is obvious, that he had been
betrothed to the "virgin widow," whom the poet there addresses,
but whose name I have been unable to learn.</p>

<p>The poem was written by Dryden while at Westminster-school,
and displays little or no promise of future excellence; being a
servile imitation of the conceits of Cleveland, and the metaphysical
wit of Cowley, exerted in numbers hardly more harmonious
than those of Donne.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">TO THE MEMORY OF Mr OLDHAM.</span></h3>

<hr class="r10" />

<p><span class="smcap">John Oldham</span>, who, from the keenness of his satirical poetry,
justly acquired the title of the <cite>English Juvenal</cite>, was born at Shipton,
in Gloucestershire, where his father was a clergyman, on 9th
August, 1653. About 1678, he was an usher in the free school
of Croydon; but having already distinguished himself by several
pieces of poetry, and particularly by four severe satirical invectives
against the order of Jesuits, then obnoxious on account of
the Popish Plot, he quitted that mean situation, to become tutor
to the family of Sir Edward Theveland, and afterwards to a son of
Sir William Hickes. Shortly after he seems to have resigned all
employment except the unthrifty trade of poetry. When Oldham
entered upon this career, he settled of course in the metropolis,
where his genius recommended him to the company of the first
wits, and to the friendship of Dryden. He did not long enjoy the
pleasures of such a life, nor did he live to experience the uncertainties,
and disappointment, and reverses, with which, above all
others, it abounds. Being seized with the small-pox, while visiting
at the seat of his patron, William Earl of Kingston, he died of
that disease on the 9th December, 1683, in the 30th year of his
age.</p>

<p>His "Remains," in verse and prose, were soon afterwards published,
with elegies and recommendatory verses prefixed by Tate,
Flatman, Durfey, Gould, Andrews, and others. But the applause
of Dryden, expressed in the following lines, was worth all the
tame panegyrics of other contemporary bards. It appears, among
the others, in "Oldham's Remains," London, 1683.</p>

<p class="p1">THE PIOUS MEMORY</p>

<p class="p2">OF</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Mrs ANNE KILLIGREW.</span></h3>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Anne Killigrew</span> was daughter of Dr Henry Killigrew,
master of the Savoy, and one of the prebendaries of Westminster,
and brother of Thomas Killigrew, renowned, in the court
of Charles II., for wit and repartee. The family, says Mr Walpole,
was remarkable for its loyalty, accomplishments, and wit;
and this young lady, who displayed great talents for painting and
poetry, promised to be one of its fairest ornaments. She was
maid of honour to the Duchess of York, and died of the small-pox
in 1685, the 25th year of her age.</p>

<p>Mrs Anne Killigrew's poems were published after her death in
a thin quarto, with a print of the author, from her portrait drawn
by herself. She also painted the portraits of the Duke of York
and of his Duchess, and executed several historical pictures, landscapes,
and pieces of still life. See <em>Lord</em> <span class="smcap">Orford's</span> <cite>Lives of the
Painters</cite>, Works, Vol. III. p. 297; and <span class="smcap">Ballard's</span> <cite>Lives of
Learned Ladies</cite>.</p>

<p>The poems of this celebrated young lady do not possess any
uncommon merit, nor are her paintings of a high class, although
preferred by Walpole to her poetry. But very slender attainments
in such accomplishments, when united with youth, beauty,
and fashion, naturally receive a much greater share of approbation
from contemporaries, than unbiassed posterity can afford to
them. Even the flinty heart of old Wood seems to have been
melted by this young lady's charms, notwithstanding her being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<em>womankind</em>, as he contemptuously calls the fair sex. He says,
that she was a Grace for a beauty, and a Muse for a wit; and that
there must have been more true history than compliment in our
author's ode, since otherwise the lady's father would not have permitted
it to go to press.&mdash;<cite>Athenæ</cite>, Vol. II. p. 1036.</p>

<p>This ode, which singularly exhibits the strong grasp and comprehensive
range of Dryden's fancy, as well as the harmony of his
numbers, seems to have been a great favourite of Dr Johnson, who,
in one place, does not hesitate to compare it to the famous ode on
St Cecilia; and, in another, calls it undoubtedly the noblest ode
that our language ever has produced. Although it is probable
that few will subscribe to the judgment of that great critic in the
present instance, yet the verses can never be read with indifference
by any admirer of poetry. We are, it is true, sometimes affronted
by a pun, or chilled by a conceit; but the general power of
thought and expression resumes its sway, in despite of the interruption
given by such instances of bad taste. In its arrangement,
the ode is what the seventeenth century called pindaric; freed,
namely, from the usual rules of order and arrangement. This
license, which led most poets, who exercised it, to extravagance
and absurdity, only gave Dryden a wider scope for the exercise
of his wonderful power of combining and uniting the most dissimilar
ideas, in a manner as ingenious as his numbers are harmonious.
Images and scenes, the richest, though most inconsistent
with each other, are sweeped together by the flood of song: we
neither see whence they arise, nor whither they are going; but
are contented to admire the richness and luxuriance in which the
poet has arrayed them. The opening of the poem has been highly
praised by Dr Johnson. "The first part," says that critic,
"flows with a torrent of enthusiasm,&mdash;<cite>Fervet immensusque ruit</cite>.
All the stanzas, indeed, are not equal. An imperial crown cannot
be one continued diamond; the gems must be held together
by some less valuable matter."</p>

<p>The stanzas, which appear to the editor peculiarly to exhibit
the spirit of the pindaric ode, are the first, second, fourth, and
fifth. Of the others, the third is too metaphysical for the occasion;
the description of the landscapes in the sixth is beautiful,
and presents our imagination with the scenery and groups of
Claude Lorraine; and that of the royal portraits, in the seventh,
has some fine lines and turns of expression: But I cannot admire,
with many critics, the comparison of the progress of genius to the
explosion of a sky-rocket; and still less the flat and familiar conclusion,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">What next she had designed, heaven only knows.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The eighth stanza is disgraced by antitheses and conceit; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
though the beginning of the ninth be beautiful and affecting, our
emotion is quelled by the nature of the consolation administered
to a sea captain, that his sister is turned into a star. The last
stanza excites ideas perhaps too solemn for poetry; and what is
worse, they are couched in poetry too fantastic to be solemn;
but the account of the resurrection of the "sacred poets," is, in

<p class="p1">UPON THE DEATH OF</p>

<h3>THE VISCOUNT OF DUNDEE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">James Graham</span> of Claverhouse, Viscount of Dundee, studied
the military art under the Prince of Orange. He first distinguished
himself by his activity in exercising the severities which the
Scottish council, in the reigns of Charles II. and James II., decreed
against the frequenters of the field-meetings and conventicles. On
this account his memory is generally reprobated by the Scottish
presbyterians; nor would history have treated him more gently,
had not the splendour of his closing life effaced the recollection
of his cruelties. When the Scottish Convention declared
for the Prince of Orange in 1688-9, Dundee left Edinburgh,
and retired to the north, where he raised the Highland clans,
to prop the sinking cause of James II. After an interval of a
few months, spent in desultory warfare, General Mackay marched,
with a regular force, towards Blair in Athole, against this
active and enterprising enemy. Upon the 17th June, 1689,
when Mackay had defiled through the rocky and precipitous
pass of Killicrankie, he found Dundee, with his Highlanders, arranged
upon an eminence opposite to the northern mouth of
the defile. Dundee permitted his adversary gradually, and at
leisure, to disengage himself from the pass, and draw up his
army in line; for, meditating a total victory, and not a mere
check or repulse, he foresaw that Mackay's retreat would be
difficult in proportion to the distance of his forces from the only
path of safety through which they could fly. He then charged
with irresistible fury, and routed Mackay's army in every direction,
saving two regiments who stood firm. But as Dundee hastened
towards them, and extended his arm as if urging the assault,
a shot penetrated his armour beneath his arm-pit, and he dropt
from his horse. He lived but a very short time, and died in the
arms of victory. With Dundee fell all hopes of restoring King
James's affairs in Scotland; the independent chieftains, who had
been overawed by his superior talents, resumed the petty altercations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which his authority had decided or suppressed; their followers
melted away without a battle; and after his death, those
who had been rather the implements than the companions of his
victory, met nothing but repulse and defeat, until all the north
of Scotland submitted to William III.</p>

<p>The epitaph, here translated by Dryden, was originally written
in Latin by Dr Pitcairn, remarkable for genius and learning, as
well as for Jacobitism. It will hardly be disputed, that the original
is much superior to the translation, though the last be
written by Dryden. In the second couplet alone, the translator
has improved upon his original:</p>


<h4>IN MORTEM VICECOMITIS TAODUNENSIS.</h4>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">ULTIME SCOTORUM! POTUIT, QUO SOSPITE SOLO,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">LIBERTAS PATRIÆ SALVA FUISSE TUÆ;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">TE MORIENTE NOVOS ACCEPIT SCOTIA CIVES,</span><br />
  <span class="i1">ACCEPITQUE NOVOS, TE MORIENTE, DEOS.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">ILLA TIBI SUPERESSE NEGAT, TU NON POTES ILLI,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">TUQUE VALE, GENTIS PRISCÆ FORTISSIME DUCTOR,</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some editions of this celebrated epitaph, which seem to have
been followed by Dryden, read the last line thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultime Scotorum atque optime, Grame, Vale.</i></span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But there is something national in calling Dundee the last of
Scots, and the last of Grames, a race distinguished for patriotism
in the struggles against England, and on this principle the last
reading should be preferred.</p>

<p class="p3">ELEONORA.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Malone</span> has given a full account of the lady in whose
honour this poem was written: "Eleonora, eldest daughter, and
at length sole heir, of Sir Henry Lee, of Ditchley, in the county
of Oxford, Baronet, by Anne, daughter of Sir John Danvers, and
sister and heir to Henry Danvers, Esq., who was nephew and heir
to Henry, Earl of Danby: She was the wife of James Bertie, first
Earl of Abingdon, and died May 31, 1691. Her lord, in 1698,
married a second wife, Catharine, daughter of Sir Thomas Chamberlaine,
Bart."</p>

<p>Her death was unexpectedly sudden, and took place in a ball-room
in her own house; a circumstance which our author has
hardly glanced at, although capable of striking illustration; and
although one might have thought he would have grasped at
whatever could assist him in executing the difficult task, of an
elegy written by desire of a nobleman whom he did not know,
in memory of a lady whom he had never seen. It is to be presumed,
that the task imposed was handsomely recompensed; for
we can hardly conceive one in itself more unpleasant or unprofitable.
Notwithstanding Dryden's professions, that he "swam
with the tide" while composing this piece, and that the variety
and multitude of his similies were owing to the divine <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">afflatus</i> and
the influence of his subject, we may be fairly permitted to doubt,
whether they did not rather originate in an attempt to supply
the lack of real sympathy, by the indulgence of a luxuriant imagination.
The commencement has been rather severely censured
by Dr Johnson; the comparison, he says, contains no illustration.
As a king would be lamented, Eleonora was lamented:
"This," observes he, "is little better than to say of a shrub, that
it is as green as a tree; or of a brook, that it waters a garden, as
a river waters a country." But, I presume, the point on which
Dryden meant the comparison to depend, was, the extent of the
lamentation occasioned by Eleonora's death; in which particular
the simile conveyed an illustration as ample, as if Dryden had
said of a myrtle, it was as tall as an oak, or of a brook, it was as
deep as the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The poem is certainly totally deficient in interest; for the character
has no peculiarity of features: But, considered as an abstract
example of female perfection, we may admire the ideal
Eleonora, as we do the fancy-piece of a celebrated painter, though
with an internal consciousness that the original never existed.</p>

<p>"Eleonora" first appeared in quarto, in 1692, probably about
the end of autumn; as Dryden alludes to the intervention of some
months between Lord Abingdon's commands and his own performance.</p>

<p class="p2">TO</p>

<p class="p2">THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</p>

<h3>THE EARL OF ABINGDON, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></h3>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">MY LORD,</span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span> <span class="smcap">he</span> commands, with which you honoured me some
months ago, are now performed: they had been sooner,
but betwixt ill health, some business, and many
troubles, I was forced to defer them till this time.
Ovid, going to his banishment, and writing from on
shipboard to his friends, excused the faults of his
poetry by his misfortunes; and told them, that
good verses never flow, but from a serene and composed
spirit. Wit, which is a kind of Mercury,
with wings fastened to his head and heels, can fly
but slowly in a damp air. I therefore chose rather
to obey you late than ill: if at least I am capable
of writing any thing, at any time, which is worthy
your perusal and your patronage. I cannot say
that I have escaped from a shipwreck; but have
only gained a rock by hard swimming, where I
may pant awhile and gather breath; for the doctors
give me a sad assurance, that my disease<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
took its leave of any man, but with a purpose
to return. However, my lord, I have laid hold on
the interval, and managed the small stock, which
age has left me, to the best advantage, in performing
this inconsiderable service to my lady's memory.
We, who are priests of Apollo, have not the
inspiration when we please; but must wait till the
God comes rushing on us, and invades us with a
fury which we are not able to resist; which gives
us double strength while the fit continues, and
leaves us languishing and spent, at its departure.
Let me not seem to boast, my lord, for I have really
felt it on this occasion, and prophesied beyond
my natural power. Let me add, and hope to be
believed, that the excellency of the subject contributed
much to the happiness of the execution; and
that the weight of thirty years was taken off me
while I was writing. I swam with the tide, and
the water under me was buoyant. The reader will
easily observe, that I was transported by the multitude
and variety of my similitudes; which are
generally the product of a luxuriant fancy, and the
wantonness of wit. Had I called in my judgment
to my assistance, I had certainly retrenched many
of them. But I defend them not; let them pass
for beautiful faults amongst the better sort of critics;
for the whole poem, though written in that
which they call heroic verse, is of the pindaric nature,
as well in the thought as the expression; and,
as such, requires the same grains of allowance for
it. It was intended, as your lordship sees in the
title, not for an elegy, but a panegyric: a kind of
apotheosis, indeed, if a heathen word may be applied
to a Christian use. And on all occasions of
praise, if we take the ancients for our patterns, we
are bound by prescription to employ the magnificence
of words, and the force of figures, to adorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the sublimity of thoughts. Isocrates amongst the
Grecian orators, and Cicero, and the younger Pliny,
amongst the Romans, have left us their precedents
for our security; for I think I need not mention
the inimitable Pindar, who stretches on these
pinions out of sight, and is carried upward, as it
were, into another world.</p>

<p>This, at least, my lord, I may justly plead, that,
if I have not performed so well as I think I have,
yet I have used my best endeavours to excel myself.
One disadvantage I have had, which is, never
to have known or seen my lady; and to draw
the lineaments of her mind from the description
which I have received from others, is for a painter
to set himself at work without the living original
before him; which, the more beautiful it is, will be
so much the more difficult for him to conceive,
when he has only a relation given him of such and
such features by an acquaintance or a friend, without
the nice touches, which give the best resemblance,
and make the graces of the picture. Every
artist is apt enough to flatter himself, and I amongst
the rest, that their own ocular observations would
have discovered more perfections, at least others,
than have been delivered to them; though I have
received mine from the best hands, that is, from
persons who neither want a just understanding of
my lady's worth, nor a due veneration for her memory.</p>

<p>Doctor Donne, the greatest wit, though not the
best poet of our nation, acknowledges, that he
had never seen Mrs Drury, whom he has made immortal
in his admirable "Anniversaries."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
had the same fortune, though I have not succeeded
to the same genius. However, I have followed his
footsteps in the design of his panegyric; which was
to raise an emulation in the living, to copy out the
example of the dead. And therefore it was, that I
once intended to have called this poem "The Pattern;"
and though, on a second consideration, I
changed the title into the name of that illustrious
person, yet the design continues, and Eleonora is
still the pattern of charity, devotion, and humility;
of the best wife, the best mother, and the best of
friends.</p>

<p>And now, my lord, though I have endeavoured
to answer your commands, yet I could not answer
it to the world, nor to my conscience, if I gave not
your lordship my testimony of being the best husband
now living: I say my testimony only; for
the praise of it is given you by yourself. They,
who despise the rules of virtue both in their practice
and their morals, will think this a very trivial
commendation. But I think it the peculiar happiness
of the Countess of Abingdon, to have been
so truly loved by you, while she was living, and so
gratefully honoured, after she was dead. Few there
are who have either had, or could have, such a loss;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and yet fewer, who carried their love and constancy
beyond the grave. The exteriors of mourning,
a decent funeral, and black habits, are the usual
stints of common husbands; and perhaps their
wives deserve no better than to be mourned with
hypocrisy, and forgot with ease. But you have
distinguished yourself from ordinary lovers, by a
real and lasting grief for the deceased; and by endeavouring
to raise for her the most durable monument,
which is that of verse. And so it would have
proved, if the workman had been equal to the work,
and your choice of the artificer as happy as your design.
Yet, as Phidias, when he had made the statue
of Minerva, could not forbear to engrave his
own name, as author of the piece; so give me leave
to hope, that, by subscribing mine to this poem, I
may live by the goddess, and transmit my name to
posterity by the memory of hers. It is no flattery
to assure your lordship, that she is remembered, in
the present age, by all who have had the honour of
her conversation and acquaintance; and that I have
never been in any company since the news of her
death was first brought me, where they have not
extolled her virtues, and even spoken the same
things of her in prose, which I have done in verse.</p>

<p>I therefore think myself obliged to your lordship
for the commission which you have given
me: how I have acquitted myself of it, must be
left to the opinion of the world, in spite of any protestation
which I can enter against the present age,
as incompetent or corrupt judges. For my comfort,
they are but Englishmen; and, as such, if they
think ill of me to-day, they are inconstant enough
to think well of me to-morrow. And after all, I
have not much to thank my fortune that I was
born amongst them. The good of both sexes are
so few, in England, that they stand like exceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
against general rules; and though one of them has
deserved a greater commendation than I could give
her, they have taken care that I should not tire my
pen with frequent exercise on the like subjects;
that praises, like taxes, should be appropriated, and
left almost as individual as the person. They say,
my talent is satire; if it be so, it is a fruitful age,
and there is an extraordinary crop to gather, but
a single hand is insufficient for such a harvest: they
have sown the dragon's teeth themselves, and it is
but just they should reap each other in lampoons.
You, my lord, who have the character of honour,
though it is not my happiness to know you, may
stand aside, with the small remainders of the English
nobility, truly such, and, unhurt yourselves,
behold the mad combat. If I have pleased you,
and some few others, I have obtained my end. You
see I have disabled myself, like an elected Speaker
of the House; yet, like him, I have undertaken the
charge, and find the burden sufficiently recompensed
by the honour. Be pleased to accept of these
my unworthy labours, this paper monument; and
let her pious memory, which I am sure is sacred to
you, not only plead the pardon of my many faults,
but gain me your protection, which is ambitiously
sought by,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;">My <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Your Lordship's</span><br />

  <span class="i0">In his &#339;conomy, and bounds his gift;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Creating for our day one single light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And his reflection too supplies the night.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Perhaps a thousand other worlds, that lie</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Are lightened by his beams, and kindly nurst,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of which our earthly dunghill is the worst.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Now, as all virtues keep the middle line,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet somewhat more to one extreme incline,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such was her soul; abhorring avarice,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bounteous, but almost bounteous to a vice;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had she given more, it had profusion been,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And turned the excess of goodness into sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">These virtues raised her fabric to the sky;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For that which is next heaven is charity.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But as high turrets for their airy steep</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And lofty cedars as far upward shoot</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As to the nether heavens they drive the root;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So low did her secure foundation lie,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She was not humble, but humility.</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Scarcely she knew that she was great, or fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or wise, beyond what other women are,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or, which is better, knew, but never durst compare.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, to be conscious of what all admire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And not be vain, advances virtue higher.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But still she found, or rather thought she found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her own worth wanting, others' to abound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ascribed above their due to every one,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unjust and scanty to herself alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Such her devotion was, as might give rules</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of speculation to disputing schools,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And teach us equally the scales to hold</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betwixt the two extremes of hot and cold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That pious heat may moderately prevail,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And we be warmed, but not be scorched with zeal.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Business might shorten, not disturb, her prayer;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Heaven had the best, if not the greater share.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An active life long orisons forbids;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet still she prayed, for still she prayed by deeds.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Her every day was sabbath; only free</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From hours of prayer, for hours of charity.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Such as the Jews from servile toil released,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where works of mercy were a part of rest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as blest angels exercise above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Varied with sacred hymns and acts of love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such sabbaths as that one she now enjoys,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">E'en that perpetual one, which she employs,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(For such vicissitudes in heaven there are)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In praise alternate, and alternate prayer.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All this she practised here, that when she sprung</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Amidst the choirs, at the first sight she sung;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sung, and was sung herself in angels' lays;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, praising her, they did her Maker praise.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All offices of heaven so well she knew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before she came, that nothing there was new;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And she was so familiarly received,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">Muse, down again precipitate thy flight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For how can mortal eyes sustain immortal light?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But as the sun in water we can bear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet not the sun, but his reflection there,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So let us view her here in what she was,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And take her image in this watery glass:</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For where such various virtues we recite,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">So she was all a sweet, whose every part,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">No single virtue we could most commend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whether the wife, the mother, or the friend;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For she was all, in that supreme degree,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The several parts lay hidden in the piece;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The occasion but exerted that, or this.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">A wife as tender, and as true withal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As the first woman was before her fall:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made for the man, of whom she was a part;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made to attract his eyes, and keep his heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A second Eve, but by no crime accurst;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As beauteous, not as brittle as the first.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had she been first, still Paradise had been,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And death had found no entrance by her sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So she not only had preserved from ill</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her sex and ours, but lived their pattern still.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Love and obedience to her lord she bore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She much obeyed him, but she loved him more:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not awed to duty by superior sway,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But taught by his indulgence to obey.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus we love God, as author of our good;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So subjects love just kings, or so they should.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor was it with ingratitude returned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In equal fires the blissful couple burned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One joy possessed them both, and in one grief they mourned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His passion still improved; he loved so fast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if he feared each day would be her last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Too true a prophet to foresee the fate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That should so soon divide their happy state;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When he to heaven entirely must restore</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That love, that heart, where he went halves before.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Yet as the soul is all in every part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So God and he might each have all her heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">So had her children too; for charity</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was not more fruitful, or more kind, than she:<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each under other by degrees they grew;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A goodly perspective of distant view.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Proud, shall I say, of her immortal fruit?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As far as pride with heavenly minds may suit.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her pious love excelled to all she bore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">New objects only multiplied it more.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as the chosen found the pearly grain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As much as every vessel could contain;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As in the blissful vision each shall share</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As much of glory as his soul can bear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So did she love, and so dispense her care.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her eldest thus, by consequence, was best,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As longer cultivated than the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The babe had all that infant care beguiles,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And early knew his mother in her smiles:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when dilated organs let in day</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To the young soul, and gave it room to play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At his first aptness, the maternal love</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Those rudiments of reason did improve:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tender age was pliant to command;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like wax it yielded to the forming hand:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">True to the artificer, the laboured mind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With ease was pious, generous, just, and kind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Soft for impression, from the first prepared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till virtue with long exercise grew hard:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With every act confirmed, and made at last</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So durable as not to be effaced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It turned to habit; and, from vices free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Goodness resolved into necessity.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus fixed she virtue's image, (that's her own,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till the whole mother in the children shone;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For that was their perfection: she was such,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They never could express her mind too much.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So unexhausted her perfections were,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, for more children, she had more to spare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For souls unborn, whom her untimely death</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deprived of bodies, and of mortal breath;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, could they take the impressions of her mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enough still left to sanctify her kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then wonder not to see this soul extend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bounds, and seek some other self, a friend;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As swelling seas to gentle rivers glide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To seek repose, and empty out the tide;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So this full soul, in narrow limits pent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unable to contain her, sought a vent</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To issue out, and in some friendly breast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Discharge her treasures, and securely rest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To unbosom all the secrets of her heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take good advice, but better to impart.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For 'tis the bliss of friendship's holy state,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To mix their minds, and to communicate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though bodies cannot, souls can penetrate:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fixed to her choice, inviolably true,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wisely choosing, for she chose but few.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some she must have; but in no one could find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A tally fitted for so large a mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The souls of friends like kings in progress are,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still in their own, though from the palace far:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Thus her friend's heart her country dwelling was,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sweet retirement to a coarser place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where pomp and ceremonies entered not,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where greatness was shut out, and business well forgot.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the imperfect draught; but short as far</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As the true height and bigness of a star</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Exceeds the measures of the astronomer.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She shines above, we know; but in what place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How near the throne, and heaven's imperial face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By our weak optics is but vainly guessed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Distance and altitude conceal the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Though all these rare endowments of the mind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were in a narrow space of life confined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The figure was with full perfection crowned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though not so large an orb, as truly round.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">As when in glory, through the public place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The spoils of conquered nations were to pass,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And but one day for triumph was allowed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The consul was constrained his pomp to crowd;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And so the swift procession hurried on,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That all, though not distinctly, might be shewn:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So in the straitened bounds of life confined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She gave but glimpses of her glorious mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And multitudes of virtues passed along,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each pressing foremost in the mighty throng,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ambitious to be seen, and then make room</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For greater multitudes that were to come.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Yet unemployed no minute slipped away;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Moments were precious in so short a stay.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The haste of heaven to have her was so great,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That some were single acts, though each complete;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But every act stood ready to repeat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her fellow-saints with busy care will look</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For her blest name in fate's eternal book;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, pleased to be outdone, with joy will see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Numberless virtues, endless charity:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">But more will wonder at so short an age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To find a blank beyond the thirtieth page;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with a pious fear begin to doubt</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The piece imperfect, and the rest torn out.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But 'twas her Saviour's time;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and, could there be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A copy near the original, 'twas she.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">As precious gums are not for lasting fire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They but perfume the temple, and expire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So was she soon exhaled, and vanished hence;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A short sweet odour, of a vast expence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She vanished, we can scarcely say she died;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For but a now did heaven and earth divide:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She passed serenely with a single breath;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This moment perfect health, the next was death:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One sigh did her eternal bliss assure;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So little penance needs, when souls are almost pure.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As gentle dreams our waking thoughts pursue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or, one dream passed, we slide into a new;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So close they follow, such wild order keep,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We think ourselves awake, and are asleep;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So softly death succeeded life in her,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She did but dream of heaven, and she was there.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">No pains she suffered, nor expired with noise;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her soul was whispered out with God's still voice;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As an old friend is beckoned to a feast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And treated like a long-familiar guest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He took her as he found, but found her so,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As one in hourly readiness to go;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">E'en on that day, in all her trim prepared,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">As early notice she from heaven had heard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some descending courier from above</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had given her timely warning to remove;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Or counselled her to dress the nuptial room,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For on that night the bridegroom was to come.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He kept his hour, and found her where she lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Clothed all in white, the livery of the day:<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Scarce had she sinned in thought, or word, or act,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unless omissions were to pass for fact;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That hardly death a consequence could draw,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To make her liable to nature's law.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, that she died, we only have to shew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mortal part of her she left below;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rest, so smooth, so suddenly she went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Looked like translation through the firmament,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or like the fiery car on the third errand sent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O happy soul! if thou canst view from high,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where thou art all intelligence, all eye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If looking up to God, or down to us,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou find'st, that any way be pervious,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Survey the ruins of thy house, and see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy widowed and thy orphan family;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Look on thy tender pledges left behind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, if thou canst a vacant minute find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From heavenly joys, that interval afford</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To thy sad children, and thy mourning lord.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">See how they grieve, mistaken in their love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And shed a beam of comfort from above;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Give them, as much as mortal eyes can bear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A transient view of thy full glories there;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That they with moderate sorrow may sustain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And mollify their losses in thy gain.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or else divide the grief; for such thou wert,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That should not all relations bear a part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It were enough to break a single heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Let this suffice: nor thou, great saint, refuse</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This humble tribute, of no vulgar muse;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Who, not by cares, or wants, or age deprest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stems a wild deluge with a dauntless breast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And dares to sing thy praises in a clime</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where vice triumphs, and virtue is a crime;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where e'en to draw the picture of thy mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is satire on the most of human kind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take it, while yet 'tis praise; before my rage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unsafely just, break loose on this bad age;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So bad, that thou thyself hadst no defence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From vice, but barely by departing hence.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Be what, and where thou art; to wish thy place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were, in the best, presumption more than grace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy relics, (such thy works of mercy are)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Have, in this poem, been my holy care.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As earth thy body keeps, thy soul the sky,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So shall this verse preserve thy memory;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For thou shalt make it live, because it sings of thee.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">So many graces in so green an age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such wit, such modesty, such strength of mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A soul at once so manly and so kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Would wonder when he turned the volume o'er,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, after some few leaves, should find no more.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nought but a blank remain, a dead void space,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A step of life that promised such a race.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We must not, dare not, think, that heaven began</span><br />

  <span class="i0">As more was never to one soul allowed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet after this profusion spent in vain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nothing but mouldering ashes to remain,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">'Twas but the original forfeit of his blood;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">For when we more than human homage pay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The charming cause is justly snatched away.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus was the crime not his, but ours alone;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And yet we murmur that he went so soon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though miracles are short, and rarely shown.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The sparkles blaze, though not the globe of fire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love him by parts, in all your numerous race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from those parts form one collected grace;</span><br />

<h3><span class="smallish">ON THE DEATH OF</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Mr PURCELL</span>.</h3>

<p class="p2">IN MUSIC.</p>

<hr class="r15" />


<p><span class="smcap">Henry Purcell</span>, as a musician, is said by Burney to have been
as much the pride of an Englishman, as Shakespeare in the drama,
Milton in epic poetry, or Locke and Newton in their several departments
of philosophy. He was born in 1658, and died in
1695, at the premature age of 37 years. Dryden, to whose productions
he had frequently added the charms of music, devoted
a tribute to his memory in the following verses, which, with others
by inferior bards, were prefixed to a collection of Purcell's music,
published two years after his death, under the title of <span class="smcap">Orpheus
Britannicus</span>. The Ode was set to music by Dr Blow, and performed
at the concert in York Buildings. Dr Burney says, that
the music is composed in fugue and imitation; but appears laboured,
and is wholly without invention or pathos.</p>

<p>The "Orpheus Britannicus" being inscribed by the widow of
Purcell to the Hon. Lady Howard, both Sir John Hawkins and
Dr Burney have been led into the mistake of supposing, that the
person so named was no other than Lady Elizabeth Dryden, our
author's wife. Mr Malone has detected this error; and indeed
the high compliments paid by the dedicator to Mr Purcell's patroness,
as an exquisite musician, a person of extensive influence,
and one whose munificence had covered the remains of Purcell
with "a fair monument," are irreconcileable with the character,
situation, and pecuniary circumstances of Lady Elizabeth Dryden.
The Lady Howard of the dedication must, unquestionably, have
been the wife of the Honourable Sir Robert Howard; whence it
follows, that the "honourable gentleman, who had the dearest, and
most deserved relation to her, and whose excellent compositions were
the subject of Purcell's last and best performances in music," was
not our author, as has been erroneously supposed, but his brother-in-law,
the said Sir Robert Howard, who continued to the last to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
be an occasional author, and to contribute songs to the dramatic
performances of the day.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Although Dryden's lady certainly did not erect Purcell's monument,
it is more than probable, judging from internal evidence,
that the poet contributed the inscription, which runs thus:</p>

<h3>MONUMENT<br />

<span class="smallish">OF</span><br />

THE MARQUIS OF WINCHESTER.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">John Powlet</span>, fifth Marquis of Winchester, was remarkable
for his steady loyalty to Charles I. He garrisoned for the king
his fine castle at Basing, and underwent a siege of two years, from
August 1643 to October 16th, 1645; on which day it was taken
by Cromwell, by storm, after having been defended with great
gallantry to the very last extremity. The Marquis had written,
in every window of the house, with a diamond, the motto <em>Aymez
Loyaulté</em>. The parliamentary leaders, incensed at this device,
burned down this noble seat, (a conflagration which Cromwell
imputes to accident,) and destroyed and plundered property to the
amount of L. 200,000. The Marquis himself was made prisoner.
The particulars of this memorable siege were printed at Oxford,
in 1645; and Oliver's account of the storm is published in Collins's
"Peerage," from a manuscript in the Museum. The Marquis
of Winchester survived the Restoration; and, having died
premier marquis of England in 1674, was buried at Englefield.
This monument, upon which our author's verses are engraved, is
made of black and white marble; and a compartment underneath
the lines bears this inscription: "The Lady Marchioness Dowager,
in testimony of her love and sorrow, gave this monument to
the memory of a most affectionate, tender husband." On a flat
marble stone, beneath the monument, is the following epitaph:
"Here lieth interred the body of the most noble and mighty
prince, John Powlet, Marquis of Winchester, Earl of Wiltshire,
Baron of St John of Basing, first Marquis of England: A man of
exemplary piety towards God, and of inviolable fidelity towards
his sovereign; in whose cause he fortified his house of Basing,
and defended it against the rebels to the last extremity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
married three wives: the first was Jane, daughter of Thomas, Viscount
Savage, and of Elizabeth his wife, daughter and co-heir of
Thomas Darcey, Earl of Rivers; by whom he had issue Charles,
now Marquis of Winchester. His second wife was Honora, daughter
of Richard Burgh, Earl of St Alban's and Clanricarde, and of
Frances, his wife, daughter and heir of Sir Francis Walsingham,
knight, and principal secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth; by
whom he had issue four sons and three daughters. His last wife,
who survived him, was Isabella, daughter of William, Viscount
Stafford, second son of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel and
Surrey, Earl Marshal of England, and of Mary his wife, sister
and sole heir of Henry, Lord Stafford, who was the heir-male of
the most high, mighty, and most noble Prince Edward, last Duke
of Buckingham of that most illustrious name and family, by
whom he had no issue. He died in the 77th year of his age, on
the 5th of March, in the year of our Lord 1674.&mdash;By Edward
Walker, Garter King of Arms."</p>

<blockquote><p><em>This Song was written on the death of Captain Digby, a younger
son of the Earl of Bristol, who was killed in the great sea-fight
between the English and Dutch, on the 28th May, 1672. The
relentless beauty to whom the lines were addressed, was Frances
Stuart, Duchess of Richmond; called in the Memoires de Grammont,
La Belle Stuart. Count Hamilton there assures us, that
her charms made conquest of Charles II. and were the occasion
of much jealousy to the Countess of Castlemaine. Dryden's song is
parodied in "The Rehearsal," in that made by "Tom Thimble's
first wife after she was dead." "Farewell, fair Armida," is
printed in the Covent-Garden Drollery, 1672, p. 16. where there
is an exculpatory answer by the Lady, but of little merit.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>A SONG FOR ST CECILIA'S DAY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">St Cecilia</span> was, according to her legend, a Roman virgin of
rank, who flourished during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
She was a Christian, and, by her purity of life, and constant
employment in the praises of her Maker, while yet on earth, obtained
intercourse with an angel. Being married to Valerianus,
a Pagan, she not only prevailed upon him to abstain from
using any familiarity with her person, but converted him and his
brother to Christianity. They were all martyrs for the faith in
the reign of Septimius Severus. Chaucer has celebrated this legend
in the "Second Nonne's Tale," which is almost a literal
translation from the "Golden Legend" of Jacobus Januensis.
As all professions and fraternities, in ancient times, made choice of
a tutelar saint, Cecilia was elected the protectress of music and
musicians. It was even believed that she had invented the organ,
although no good authority can be discovered for such an assertion.
Her festival was celebrated from an early period by those
of the profession over whom she presided.</p>

<p>The revival of letters, with the Restoration, was attended with a
similar resuscitation of the musical art; but the formation of a
Musical Society, for the annual commemoration of St Cecilia's
day, did not take place until 1680. An ode, written for the occasion,
was set to music by the most able professor, and rehearsed
before the society and their stewards upon the 22d November,
the day dedicated to the patroness. The first effusions of this
kind are miserable enough. Mr Malone has preserved a few verses
of an ode, by an anonymous author, in 1633; that of 1684
was furnished by Oldham, whom our author has commemorated
by an elegy; that of 1685 was written by Nahum Tate, and is
given by Mr Malone, Vol. I. p. 274. There was no performance
in 1686; and, in 1687, Dryden furnished the following ode,
which was set to music by Draghi, an eminent Italian composer.
Of the annual festival, Motteux gives the following account:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"The 22d of November, being St Cecilia's day, is observed
throughout all Europe by the lovers of music. In Italy, Germany,
France, and other countries, prizes are distributed on that
day, in some of the most considerable towns, to such as make the
best anthem in her praise.... On that day, or the next when
it falls on a Sunday, ... most of the lovers of music, whereof many
are persons of the first rank, meet at Stationers' Hall in London,
not through a principle of superstition, but to propagate the
advancement of that divine science. A splendid entertainment is
provided, and before it is always a performance of music, by the
best voices and hands in town: the words, which are always in the
patronesses praise, are set by some of the greatest masters. This
year [1691] Dr John Blow, that famous musician, composed the
music; and Mr D'Urfey, whose skill in things of that nature is
well known, made the words. Six stewards are chosen for each
ensuing year; four of which are either persons of quality or gentlemen
of note, and the two last either gentlemen of their majesties
music, or some of the chief masters in town.... This feast
is one of the genteelest in the world; there are no formalities nor
gatherings as at others, and the appearance there is always very
splendid. Whilst the company is at table, the hautboys and trumpets
play successively."</p>

<p>The merit of the following Ode has been so completely lost in
that of "Alexander's Feast," that few readers give themselves even
the trouble of attending to it. Yet the first stanza has exquisite
merit; and although the power of music is announced, in those
which follow, in a manner more abstracted and general, and,
therefore, less striking than when its influence upon Alexander and
his chiefs is placed before our eyes, it is perhaps only our intimate
acquaintance with the second ode that leads us to undervalue the
first, although containing the original ideas, so exquisitely brought
out and embodied in "Alexander's Feast."</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<blockquote><p class="right"><em>Anno 1699.</em></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">my lord</span>,</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span> <span class="smcap">ome</span> estates are held, in England, by paying a fine
at the change of every lord. I have enjoyed the patronage
of your family, from the time of your excellent
grandfather to this present day. I have dedicated
the translations of the "Lives of Plutarch"
to the first duke;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and have celebrated the memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of your heroic father.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Though I am very short of
the age of Nestor, yet I have lived to a third generation
of your house; and, by your grace's favour,
am admitted still to hold from you by the same tenure.</p>

<p>I am not vain enough to boast, that I have deserved
the value of so illustrious a line; but my fortune
is the greater, that, for three descents, they
have been pleased to distinguish my poems from
those of other men, and have accordingly made me
their peculiar care. May it be permitted me to say,
that as your grandfather and father were cherished
and adorned with honours by two successive monarchs,
so I have been esteemed and patronized by
the grandfather, the father, and the son, descended
from one of the most ancient, most conspicuous,
and most deserving families in Europe.</p>

<p>It is true, that by delaying the payment of my
last fine, when it was due by your grace's accession to
the titles and patrimonies of your house, I may
seem, in rigour of law, to have made a forfeiture of
my claim; yet my heart has always been devoted to
your service; and since you have been graciously
pleased, by your permission of this address, to accept
the tender of my duty, it is not yet too late to
lay these poems at your feet.</p>

<p>The world is sensible, that you worthily succeed
not only to the honours of your ancestors, but also
to their virtues. The long chain of magnanimity,
courage, easiness of access, and desire of doing
good, even to the prejudice of your fortune, is so
far from being broken in your grace, that the precious
metal yet runs pure to the newest link of it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
which I will not call the last, because I hope and
pray it may descend to late posterity; and your
flourishing youth, and that of your excellent duchess,
are happy omens of my wish.</p>

<p>It is observed by Livy, and by others, that some
of the noblest Roman families retained a resemblance
of their ancestry, not only in their shapes
and features, but also in their manners, their qualities,
and the distinguishing characters of their
minds. Some lines were noted for a stern, rigid
virtue; savage, haughty, parsimonious, and unpopular;
others were more sweet and affable, made
of a more pliant paste, humble, courteous, and obliging;
studious of doing charitable offices, and diffusive
of the goods which they enjoyed. The last
of these is the proper and indelible character of your
grace's family. God Almighty has endued you
with a softness, a beneficence, an attractive behaviour
winning on the hearts of others, and so sensible
of their misery, that the wounds of fortune
seem not inflicted on them, but on yourself.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> You
are so ready to redress, that you almost prevent
their wishes, and always exceed their expectations;
as if what was yours was not your own, and not
given you to possess, but to bestow on wanting
merit. But this is a topic which I must cast in
shades, lest I offend your modesty; which is so far
from being ostentatious of the good you do, that it
blushes even to have it known; and, therefore, I
must leave you to the satisfaction and testimony of
your own conscience, which, though it be a silent
panegyric, is yet the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>You are so easy of access, that Poplicola<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> was not
more, whose doors were opened on the outside to
save the people even the common civility of asking
entrance; where all were equally admitted; where
nothing that was reasonable was denied; where
misfortune was a powerful recommendation; and
where, I can scarce forbear saying, that want itself
was a powerful mediator, and was next to merit.</p>

<p>The history of Peru assures us, that their Incas,
above all their titles, esteemed that the highest,
which called them <em>lovers of the poor</em>;&mdash;a name more
glorious than the Felix, Pius, and Augustus, of the
Roman emperors, which were epithets of flattery,
deserved by few of them; and not running in a
blood like the perpetual gentleness, and inherent
goodness, of the Ormond family.</p>

<p>Gold, as it is the purest, so it is the softest and
most ductile of all metals. Iron, which is the hardest,
gathers rust, corrodes itself, and is, therefore,
subject to corruption. It was never intended for
coins and medals, or to bear the faces and inscriptions
of the great. Indeed, it is fit for armour, to
bear off insults, and preserve the wearer in the day
of battle; but, the danger once repelled, it is laid
aside by the brave, as a garment too rough for civil
conversation; a necessary guard in war, but too
harsh and cumbersome in peace, and which keeps
off the embraces of a more humane life.</p>

<p>For this reason, my lord, though you have courage
in an heroical degree, yet I ascribe it to you but
as your second attribute: mercy, beneficence, and
compassion, claim precedence, as they are first in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the divine nature. An intrepid courage, which is
inherent in your grace, is at best but a holiday-kind
of virtue, to be seldom exercised, and never but in
cases of necessity; affability, mildness, tenderness,
and a word, which I would fain bring back to its
original signification of virtue, I mean good-nature,
are of daily use. They are the bread of mankind,
and staff of life. Neither sighs, nor tears, nor
groans, nor curses of the vanquished, follow acts of
compassion and of charity; but a sincere pleasure,
and serenity of mind, in him who performs an action
of mercy, which cannot suffer the misfortunes
of another without redress, lest they should bring
a kind of contagion along with them, and pollute
the happiness which he enjoys.</p>

<p>Yet since the perverse tempers of mankind, since
oppression on one side, and ambition on the other,
are sometimes the unavoidable occasions of war,
that courage, that magnanimity, and resolution,
which is born with you, cannot be too much commended:
And here it grieves me that I am scanted
in the pleasure of dwelling on many of your actions;
but &#945;&#7984;&#948;&#941;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953; &#932;&#961;&#8182;&#945;&#962; is an expression which Tully often
uses, when he would do what he dares not, and
fears the censure of the Romans.</p>

<p>I have sometimes been forced to amplify on
others; but here, where the subject is so fruitful,
that the harvest overcomes the reaper, I am shortened
by my chain, and can only see what is forbidden
me to reach; since it is not permitted me to
commend you according to the extent of my wishes,
and much less is it in my power to make my
commendations equal to your merits.</p>

<p>Yet, in this frugality of your praises, there are
some things which I cannot omit, without detracting
from your character. You have so formed
your own education, as enables you to pay the debt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
you owe your country, or, more properly speaking,
both your countries; because you were born, I may
almost say, in purple, at the castle of Dublin, when
your grandfather was lord-lieutenant, and have since
been bred in the court of England.</p>

<p>If this address had been in verse, I might have
called you, as Claudian calls Mercury, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Numen commune,
gemino faciens commercia mundo</i>. The better
to satisfy this double obligation, you have early cultivated
the genius you have to arms, that when the
service of Britain or Ireland shall require your courage
and your conduct, you may exert them both
to the benefit of either country. You began in the
cabinet what you afterwards practised in the camp;
and thus both Lucullus and Cæsar (to omit a crowd
of shining Romans) formed themselves to the war,
by the study of history, and by the examples of the
greatest captains, both of Greece and Italy, before
their time. I name those two commanders in particular,
because they were better read in chronicle
than any of the Roman leaders; and that Lucullus,
in particular, having only the theory of war from
books, was thought fit, without practice, to be sent
into the field, against the most formidable enemy of
Rome. Tully, indeed, was called the learned consul
in derision; but then he was not born a soldier;
his head was turned another way: when he read the
tactics, he was thinking on the bar, which was his
field of battle. The knowledge of warfare is thrown
away on a general, who dares not make use of what
he knows. I commend it only in a man of courage
and resolution; in him it will direct his martial spirit,
and teach him the way to the best victories,
which are those that are least bloody, and which,
though achieved by the hand, are managed by the
head. Science distinguishes a man of honour from
one of those athletic brutes whom, undeservedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
we call heroes. Cursed be the poet, who first honoured
with that name a mere Ajax, a man-killing
idiot! The Ulysses of Ovid upbraids his ignorance,
that he understood not the shield for which he
pleaded; there was engraven on it plans of cities,
and maps of countries, which Ajax could not comprehend,
but looked on them as stupidly as his fellow-beast,
the lion. But, on the other side, your
grace has given yourself the education of his rival;
you have studied every spot of ground in Flanders,
which, for these ten years past, has been the scene
of battles, and of sieges. No wonder if you performed
your part with such applause, on a theatre
which you understood so well.</p>

<p>If I designed this for a poetical encomium, it
were easy to enlarge on so copious a subject; but,
confining myself to the severity of truth, and to
what is becoming me to say, I must not only pass
over many instances of your military skill, but also
those of your assiduous diligence in the war, and of
your personal bravery, attended with an ardent
thirst of honour; a long train of generosity; profuseness
of doing good; a soul unsatisfied with all
it has done, and an unextinguished desire of doing
more. But all this is matter for your own historians;
I am, as Virgil says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spatiis exclusus iniquis</i>.</p>

<p>Yet, not to be wholly silent of all your charities,
I must stay a little on one action, which preferred
the relief of others to the consideration of yourself.
When, in the battle of Landen, your heat of courage
(a fault only pardonable to your youth) had
transported you so far before your friends, that they
were unable to follow, much less to succour you;
when you were not only dangerously, but, in all
appearance, mortally wounded; when in that desperate
condition you were made prisoner, and carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to Namur, at that time in possession of the
French;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> then it was, my lord, that you took a considerable
part of what was remitted to you of your
own revenues, and, as a memorable instance of
your heroic charity, put it into the hands of Count
Guiscard, who was governor of the place, to be distributed
among your fellow-prisoners. The French
commander, charmed with the greatness of your
soul, accordingly consigned it to the use for which
it was intended by the donor; by which means the
lives of so many miserable men were saved, and a
comfortable provision made for their subsistence,
who had otherwise perished, had you not been the
companion of their misfortune; or rather sent by
Providence, like another Joseph, to keep out famine
from invading those, whom, in humility, you
called your brethren. How happy was it for those
poor creatures, that your grace was made their fellow-sufferer?
And how glorious for you, that you
chose to want, rather than not relieve the wants of
others? The heathen poet, in commending the charity
of Dido to the Trojans, spoke like a Christian:</p>

contrary principles, must praise this action as the
most eminent for piety, not only in this degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
age, but almost in any of the former; when
men were made <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de meliore luto</i>; when examples of
charity were frequent, and when there were in being,</p>

<p>No envy can detract from this; it will shine in history,
and, like swans, grow whiter the longer it
endures; and the name of Ormond will be more
celebrated in his captivity, than in his greatest
triumphs.</p>

<p>But all actions of your grace are of a piece, as waters
keep the tenor of their fountains: your compassion
is general, and has the same effect as well
on enemies as friends. It is so much in your nature
to do good, that your life is but one continued
act of placing benefits on many; as the sun is always
carrying his light to some part or other of the
world. And were it not that your reason guides
you where to give, I might almost say, that you
could not help bestowing more than is consisting
with the fortune of a private man, or with the will
of any but an Alexander.</p>

<p>What wonder is it then, that, being born for a
blessing to mankind, your supposed death in that
engagement was so generally lamented through the
nation? The concernment for it was as universal as
the loss; and though the gratitude might be counterfeit
in some, yet the tears of all were real: where
every man deplored his private part in that calamity,
and even those who had not tasted of your favours,
yet built so much on the fame of your beneficence,
that they bemoaned the loss of their expectations.</p>

<p>This brought the untimely death of your great
father into fresh remembrance,&mdash;as if the same decree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
had passed on two short successive generations
of the virtuous; and I repeated to myself the same
verses which I had formerly applied to him:</p>

<p>But, to the joy not only of all good men, but
mankind in general, the unhappy omen took not
place. You are still living, to enjoy the blessings
and applause of all the good you have performed,
the prayers of multitudes whom you have obliged,
for your long prosperity, and that your power of
doing generous and charitable actions may be as
extended as your will; which is by none more zealously
desired than by</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is with a poet, as with a man who designs to
build, and is very exact, as he supposes, in casting
up the cost beforehand; but, generally speaking,
he is mistaken in his account, and reckons short in
the expence he first intended. He alters his mind
as the work proceeds, and will have this or that
convenience more, of which he had not thought
when he began. So has it happened to me; I have
built a house, where I intended but a lodge; yet
with better success than a certain nobleman, who,
beginning with a dog-kennel, never lived to finish
the palace he had contrived.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>From translating the First of Homer's "Iliads,"
(which I intended as an essay to the whole work,)
I proceeded to the translation of the Twelfth Book
of Ovid's "Metamorphoses," because it contains,
among other things, the causes, the beginning, and
ending, of the Trojan war. Here I ought in reason
to have stopped; but the speeches of Ajax and
Ulysses lying next in my way, I could not balk
them. When I had compassed them, I was so taken
with the former part of the Fifteenth Book,
which is the masterpiece of the whole "Metamorphoses,"
that I enjoined myself the pleasing task of
rendering it into English. And now I found, by
the number of my verses, that they began to swell
into a little volume; which gave me an occasion
of looking backward on some beauties of my author,
in his former books: There occurred to me
the "Hunting of the Boar," "Cinyras and Myrrha,"
the good-natured story of "Baucis and Philemon,"
with the rest, which I hope I have translated closely
enough, and given them the same turn of verse
which they had in the original;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and this I may
say, without vanity, is not the talent of every poet.
He who has arrived the nearest to it, is the ingenious
and learned Sandys, the best versifier of the
former age; if I may properly call it by that name,
which was the former part of this concluding century.
For Spenser and Fairfax both flourished in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth; great masters in our
language, and who saw much farther into the beauties
of our numbers, than those who immediately
followed them. Milton was the poetical son of
Spenser, and Mr Waller of Fairfax; for we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
our lineal descents and clans as well as other families.
Spenser more than once insinuates, that the
soul of Chaucer was transfused into his body;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and
that he was begotten by him two hundred years after
his decease. Milton has acknowledged to me,
that Spenser was his original; and many besides
myself have heard our famous Waller own, that he
derived the harmony of his numbers from "Godfrey
of Bulloigne," which was turned into English by Mr
Fairfax.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>But to return. Having done with Ovid for this
time, it came into my mind, that our old English
poet, Chaucer, in many things resembled him, and
that with no disadvantage on the side of the modern
author, as I shall endeavour to prove when I
compare them; and as I am, and always have been,
studious to promote the honour of my native country,
so I soon resolved to put their merits to the
trial, by turning some of the "Canterbury Tales"
into our language, as it is now refined; for by this
means, both the poets being set in the same light,
and dressed in the same English habit, story to be
compared with story, a certain judgment may be
made betwixt them by the reader, without obtruding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
my opinion on him. Or, if I seem partial to
my countryman and predecessor in the laurel, the
friends of antiquity are not few; and, besides many
of the learned, Ovid has almost all the beaux, and
the whole fair sex, his declared patrons. Perhaps
I have assumed somewhat more to myself than they
allow me, because I have adventured to sum up the
evidence; but the readers are the jury, and their
privilege remains entire, to decide according to the
merits of the cause; or, if they please, to bring it
to another hearing before some other court. In the
mean time, to follow the thread of my discourse, (as
thoughts, according to Mr Hobbes, have always
some connection,) so from Chaucer I was led to
think on Boccace, who was not only his contemporary,
but also pursued the same studies; wrote novels
in prose, and many works in verse; particularly
is said to have invented the octave rhyme, or
stanza of eight lines, which ever since has been
maintained by the practice of all Italian writers,
who are, or at least assume the title of heroic poets.
He and Chaucer, among other things, had this in
common, that they refined their mother-tongues;
but with this difference, that Dante had begun to
file their language, at least in verse, before the time
of Boccace, who likewise received no little help
from his master Petrarch; but the reformation of
their prose was wholly owing to Boccace himself,
who is yet the standard of purity in the Italian
tongue, though many of his phrases are become obsolete,
as, in process of time, it must needs happen.
Chaucer (as you have formerly been told by our
learned Mr Rymer<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>) first adorned and amplified our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
barren tongue from the Provençal, which was then
the most polished of all the modern languages; but
this subject has been copiously treated by that great
critic, who deserves no little commendation from
us his countrymen. For these reasons of time, and
resemblance of genius, in Chaucer and Boccace, I
resolved to join them in my present work; to
which I have added some original papers of my
own, which, whether they are equal or inferior
to my other poems, an author is the most improper
judge; and therefore I leave them wholly to the
mercy of the reader. I will hope the best, that they
will not be condemned; but if they should, I have
the excuse of an old gentleman, who, mounting on
horseback before some ladies, when I was present,
got up somewhat heavily, but desired of the fair
spectators, that they would count fourscore and
eight before they judged him. By the mercy of
God, I am already come within twenty years of his
number; a cripple in my limbs,&mdash;but what decays
are in my mind the reader must determine. I think
myself as vigorous as ever in the faculties of my
soul, excepting only my memory, which is not impaired
to any great degree; and if I lose not more
of it, I have no great reason to complain. What
judgment I had, increases rather than diminishes;
and thoughts, such as they are, come crowding in
so fast upon me, that my only difficulty is to chuse
or to reject, to run them into verse, or to give them
the other harmony of prose: I have so long studied
and practised both, that they are grown into a habit,
and become familiar to me. In short, though
I may lawfully plead some part of the old gentleman's
excuse, yet I will reserve it till I think I have
greater need, and ask no grains of allowance for
the faults of this my present work, but those which
are given of course to human frailty. I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
trouble my reader with the shortness of time in
which I writ it, or the several intervals of sickness.
They who think too well of their own performances,
are apt to boast in their prefaces how little time
their works have cost them, and what other business
of more importance interfered; but the reader
will be as apt to ask the question, why they allowed
not a longer time to make their works more
perfect? and why they had so despicable an opinion
of their judges, as to thrust their indigested
stuff upon them, as if they deserved no better?</p>

<p>With this account of my present undertaking, I
conclude the first part of this discourse: in the second
part, as at a second sitting, though I alter not
the draught, I must touch the same features over
again, and change the dead-colouring of the whole.
In general I will only say, that I have written nothing
which savours of immorality or profaneness;
at least, I am not conscious to myself of any such
intention. If there happen to be found an irreverent
expression, or a thought too wanton, they are
crept into my verses through my inadvertency. If
the searchers find any in the cargo, let them be
staved or forfeited, like counterbanded goods; at
least, let their authors be answerable for them, as
being but imported merchandize, and not of my
own manufacture. On the other side, I have endeavoured
to chuse such fables, both ancient and
modern, as contain in each of them some instructive
moral; which I could prove by induction, but
the way is tedious, and they leap foremost into
sight, without the reader's trouble of looking after
them. I wish I could affirm, with a safe conscience,
that I had taken the same care in all my former
writings; for it must be owned, that supposing
verses are never so beautiful or pleasing, yet, if they
contain any thing which shocks religion or good
manners, they are at best what Horace says of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
numbers without good sense, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Versus inopes rerum,
nugæque canoræ</i>. Thus far, I hope, I am right in
court, without renouncing to my other right of self-defence,
where I have been wrongfully accused, and
my sense wire-drawn into blasphemy, or bawdry, as
it has often been by a religious lawyer,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> in a late
pleading against the stage; in which he mixes truth
with falsehood, and has not forgotten the old rule of
calumniating strongly, that something may remain.</p>

<p>I resume the thread of my discourse with the
first of my translations, which was the first "Ilias"
of Homer.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> If it shall please God to give me longer
life, and moderate health, my intentions are to
translate the whole "Ilias;" provided still that I
meet with those encouragements from the public,
which may enable me to proceed in my undertaking
with some cheerfulness. And this I dare
assure the world beforehand, that I have found, by
trial, Homer a more pleasing task than Virgil,
though I say not the translation will be less laborious;
for the Grecian is more according to my genius
than the Latin poet. In the works of the two
authors we may read their manners, and natural inclinations,
which are wholly different. Virgil was
of a quiet, sedate temper; Homer was violent, impetuous,
and full of fire. The chief talent of Virgil
was propriety of thoughts, and ornament of
words: Homer was rapid in his thoughts, and took
all the liberties, both of numbers and of expressions,
which his language, and the age in which he lived,
allowed him. Homer's invention was more copious,
Virgil's more confined; so that if Homer had not
led the way, it was not in Virgil to have begun heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
poetry; for nothing can be more evident, than
that the Roman poem is but the second part of the
"Ilias;" a continuation of the same story, and the
persons already formed. The manners of Æneas
are those of Hector, superadded to those which
Homer gave him. The adventures of Ulysses in
the "Odysses," are imitated in the first Six Books
of Virgil's "Æneis;" and though the accidents are
not the same, (which would have argued him of a
servile copying, and total barrenness of invention,)
yet the seas were the same in which both the heroes
wandered; and Dido cannot be denied to be
the poetical daughter of Calypso. The six latter
Books of Virgil's poem are the four-and-twenty
"Iliads" contracted; a quarrel occasioned by a lady,
a single combat, battles fought, and a town besieged.
I say not this in derogation to Virgil, neither
do I contradict any thing which I have formerly
said in his just praise; for his episodes are
almost wholly of his own invention, and the form
which he has given to the telling makes the tale
his own, even though the original story had been
the same. But this proves, however, that Homer
taught Virgil to design; and if invention be the
first virtue of an epic poet, then the Latin poem
can only be allowed the second place. Mr Hobbes,
in the preface to his own bald translation of the
"Ilias," (studying poetry as he did mathematics,
when it was too late,) Mr Hobbes,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> I say, begins the
praise of Homer where he should have ended it.
He tells us, that the first beauty of an epic poem
consists in diction; that is, in the choice of words,
and harmony of numbers. Now the words are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
colouring of the work, which, in the order of nature,
is last to be considered; the design, the disposition,
the manners, and the thoughts, are all before
it: where any of those are wanting or imperfect,
so much wants or is imperfect in the imitation
of human life, which is in the very definition
of a poem. Words, indeed, like glaring colours,
are the first beauties that arise, and strike the sight;
but, if the draught be false or lame, the figures ill
disposed, the manners obscure or inconsistent, or
the thoughts unnatural, then the finest colours are
but daubing, and the piece is a beautiful monster
at the best. Neither Virgil nor Homer were deficient
in any of the former beauties; but in this last,
which is expression, the Roman poet is at least
equal to the Grecian, as I have said elsewhere: supplying
the poverty of his language by his musical
ear, and by his diligence.</p>

<p>But to return. Our two great poets being so
different in their tempers, one choleric and sanguine,
the other phlegmatic and melancholic; that which
makes them excel in their several ways is, that
each of them has followed his own natural inclination,
as well in forming the design, as in the execution
of it. The very heroes show their authors:
Achilles is hot, impatient, revengeful,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Impiger, iracundus, inexorabilis, acer, &amp;c.</i></span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Æneas patient, considerate, careful of his people,
and merciful to his enemies; ever submissive to the
will of heaven:</p>

<div class="container">

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quò fata trahunt retrahuntque, sequamur.</i></span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I could please myself with enlarging on this subject,
but am forced to defer it to a fitter time. From
all I have said, I will only draw this inference, that
the action of Homer, being more full of vigour than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that of Virgil, according to the temper of the writer,
is of consequence more pleasing to the reader.
One warms you by degrees; the other sets you on
fire all at once, and never intermits his heat. It is
the same difference which Longinus makes betwixt
the effects of eloquence in Demosthenes and Tully;
one persuades, the other commands. You never
cool while you read Homer, even not in the Second
Book (a graceful flattery to his countrymen); but
he hastens from the ships, and concludes not that
book till he has made you amends by the violent
playing of a new machine. From thence he hurries
on his action with variety of events, and ends it in
less compass than two months. This vehemence
of his, I confess, is more suitable to my temper;
and, therefore, I have translated his First Book
with greater pleasure than any part of Virgil; but
it was not a pleasure without pains. The continual
agitations of the spirits must needs be a weakening
of any constitution, especially in age; and many
pauses are required for refreshment betwixt the
heats; the "Ilias," of itself, being a third part
longer than all Virgil's works together.</p>

<p>This is what I thought needful in this place to
say of Homer. I proceed to Ovid and Chaucer;
considering the former only in relation to the latter.
With Ovid ended the golden age of the Roman
tongue; from Chaucer the purity of the English
tongue began. The manners of the poets were not
unlike. Both of them were well-bred, well-natured,
amorous, and libertine, at least in their writings;
it may be, also in their lives. Their studies were
the same,&mdash;philosophy and philology. Both of them
were knowing in astronomy; of which Ovid's
"Books of the Roman Feasts," and Chaucer's "Treatise
of the Astrolabe," are sufficient witnesses. But
Chaucer was likewise an astrologer, as were Virgil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Horace, Persius, and Manilius. Both writ with
wonderful facility and clearness; neither were great
inventors: for Ovid only copied the Grecian fables,
and most of Chaucer's stories were taken from his
Italian contemporaries, or their predecessors. Boccace
his "Decameron" was first published; and from
thence our Englishman has borrowed many of his
"Canterbury Tales." Yet that of "Palamon and
Arcite" was written, in all probability, by some Italian
wit, in a former age as I shall prove hereafter.
The tale of "Grisilde" was the invention of Petrarch;
by him sent to Boccace, from whom it
came to Chaucer.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> "Troilus and Cressida" was also
written by a Lombard author,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> but much amplified
by our English translator, as well as beautified; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
genius of our countrymen in general, being rather
to improve an invention than to invent themselves,
as is evident not only in our poetry, but in many
of our manufactures.&mdash;I find I have anticipated already,
and taken up from Boccace before I come to
him: but there is so much less behind; and I am
of the temper of most kings, who love to be in debt,
are all for present money, no matter how they pay
it afterwards: besides, the nature of a preface is
rambling, never wholly out of the way, nor in it.
This I have learned from the practice of honest
Montaigne, and return at my pleasure to Ovid and
Chaucer, of whom I have little more to say.</p>

<p>Both of them built on the inventions of other
men; yet since Chaucer had something of his own,
as "The Wife of Bath's Tale," "The Cock and the
Fox,"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> which I have translated, and some others, I
may justly give our countryman the precedence in
that part; since I can remember nothing of Ovid
which was wholly his. Both of them understood
the manners; under which name I comprehend the
passions, and, in a larger sense, the descriptions of
persons, and their very habits. For an example, I
see Baucis and Philemon as perfectly before me, as
if some ancient painter had drawn them; and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the Pilgrims in the "Canterbury Tales," their humours,
their features, and the very dress, as distinctly
as if I had supped with them at the Tabard<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
in Southwark. Yet even there, too, the figures of
Chaucer are much more lively, and set in a better
light; which though I have not time to prove, yet
I appeal to the reader, and am sure he will clear me
from partiality.&mdash;The thoughts and words remain
to be considered, in the comparison of the two
poets, and I have saved myself one half of that labour,
by owning that Ovid lived when the Roman
tongue was in its meridian; Chaucer, in the dawning
of our language: therefore that part of the
comparison stands not on an equal foot, any more
than the diction of Ennius and Ovid, or of Chaucer
and our present English. The words are given up,
as a post not to be defended in our poet, because
he wanted the modern art of fortifying. The
thoughts remain to be considered; and they are to
be measured only by their propriety; that is, as
they flow more or less naturally from the persons
described, on such and such occasions. The vulgar
judges, which are nine parts in ten of all nations,
who call conceits and jingles wit, who see Ovid full
of them, and Chaucer altogether without them, will
think me little less than mad for preferring the
Englishman to the Roman. Yet, with their leave,
I must presume to say, that the things they admire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
are only glittering trifles, and so far from being
witty, that in a serious poem they are nauseous, because
they are unnatural. Would any man, who is
ready to die for love, describe his passion like Narcissus?
Would he think of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inopem me copia fecit</i>, and
a dozen more of such expressions, poured on the
neck of one another, and signifying all the same
thing? If this were wit, was this a time to be witty,
when the poor wretch was in the agony of
death? This is just John Littlewit, in "Bartholomew
Fair," who had a conceit (as he tells you) left
him in his misery; a miserable conceit. On these
occasions the poet should endeavour to raise pity;
but, instead of this, Ovid is tickling you to laugh.
Virgil never made use of such machines when he
was moving you to commiserate the death of Dido:
he would not destroy what he was building.
Chaucer makes Arcite violent in his love, and unjust
in the pursuit of it; yet, when he came to die,
he made him think more reasonably: he repents
not of his love, for that had altered his character;
but acknowledges the injustice of his proceedings,
and resigns Emilia to Palamon. What would Ovid
have done on this occasion? He would certainly
have made Arcite witty on his death-bed;&mdash;he had
complained he was farther off from possession, by
being so near, and a thousand such boyisms, which
Chaucer rejected as below the dignity of the subject.
They who think otherwise, would, by the
same reason, prefer Lucan and Ovid to Homer and
Virgil, and Martial to all four of them. As for the
turn of words, in which Ovid particularly excels all
poets, they are sometimes a fault, and sometimes a
beauty, as they are used properly or improperly;
but in strong passions always to be shunned, because
passions are serious, and will admit no playing.
The French have a high value for them; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I confess, they are often what they call delicate,
when they are introduced with judgment; but
Chaucer writ with more simplicity, and followed
nature more closely than to use them.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> I have thus
far, to the best of my knowledge, been an upright
judge betwixt the parties in competition, not meddling
with the design nor the disposition of it; because
the design was not their own; and in the disposing
of it they were equal.&mdash;It remains that I say
somewhat of Chaucer in particular.</p>

<p>In the first place, as he is the father of English
poetry, so I hold him in the same degree of veneration
as the Grecians held Homer, or the Romans
Virgil. He is a perpetual fountain of good sense;
learned in all sciences; and, therefore, speaks properly
on all subjects. As he knew what to say, so
he knows also when to leave off; a continence
which is practised by few writers, and scarcely by
any of the ancients, excepting Virgil and Horace.
One of our late great poets<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> is sunk in his reputation,
because he could never forgive any conceit
which came in his way; but swept, like a drag-net,
great and small. There was plenty enough, but the
dishes were ill sorted; whole pyramids of sweet-meats
for boys and women, but little of solid meat
for men. All this proceeded not from any want of
knowledge, but of judgment. Neither did he want
that in discerning the beauties and faults of other
poets, but only indulged himself in the luxury of
writing; and perhaps knew it was a fault, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
hoped the reader would not find it. For this reason,
though he must always be thought a great
poet, he is no longer esteemed a good writer; and
for ten impressions, which his works have had in so
many successive years, yet at present a hundred books
are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth; for, as
my last Lord Rochester said, though somewhat profanely,
"Not being of God, he could not stand."</p>

<p>Chaucer followed nature every where, but was
never so bold to go beyond her; and there is a
great difference of being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">poeta</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nimis poeta</i>, if
we may believe Catullus, as much as betwixt a modest
behaviour and affectation. The verse of Chaucer,
I confess, is not harmonious to us; but it is
like the eloquence of one whom Tacitus commends,
it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auribus istius temporis accommodata</i>. They
who lived with him, and some time after him,
thought it musical; and it continues so, even in
our judgment, if compared with the numbers of
Lidgate and Gower, his contemporaries:&mdash;there is
the rude sweetness of a Scotch tune in it, which is
natural and pleasing, though not perfect. It is
true, I cannot go so far as he<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> who published the
last edition of him; for he would make us believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the fault is in our ears, and that there were really
ten syllables in a verse where we find but nine:
but this opinion is not worth confuting; it is so
gross and obvious an error, that common sense
(which is a rule in every thing but matters of faith
and revelation) must convince the reader, that
equality of numbers, in every verse which we call
heroic, was either not known, or not always practised,
in Chaucer's age. It were an easy matter to
produce some thousands of his verses, which are
lame for want of half a foot, and sometimes a whole
one, and which no pronunciation can make otherwise.
We can only say, that he lived in the infancy
of our poetry, and that nothing is brought to
perfection at the first. We must be children before
we grow men. There was an Ennius, and in process
of time a Lucilius, and a Lucretius, before Virgil
and Horace; even after Chaucer there was a
Spenser, a Harrington, a Fairfax, before Waller and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Denham were in being; and our numbers were in
their nonage till these last appeared. I need say
little of his parentage, life, and fortunes; they are
to be found at large in all the editions of his Works.
He was employed abroad, and favoured, by Edward
III., Richard II., and Henry IV., and was poet, as
I suppose, to all three of them.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In Richard's
time, I doubt, he was a little dipt in the rebellion
of the Commons;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and being brother-in-law to
John of Gaunt, it was no wonder if he followed the
fortunes of that family; and was well with Henry
IV. when he had deposed his predecessor. Neither
is it to be admired, that Henry, who was a wise as
well as a valiant prince, who claimed by succession,
and was sensible that his title was not sound, but
was rightfully in Mortimer, who had married the
heir of York; it was not to be admired, I say, if
that great politician should be pleased to have the
greatest wit of those times in his interests, and to
be the trumpet of his praises. Augustus had given
him the example, by the advice of Mæcenas, who
recommended Virgil and Horace to him; whose
praises helped to make him popular while he was
alive, and after his death have made him precious
to posterity. As for the religion of our poet, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
seems to have some little bias towards the opinions
of Wickliffe, after John of Gaunt his patron; somewhat
of which appears in the tale of "Pierce Plowman:"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
yet I cannot blame him for inveighing so
sharply against the vices of the clergy in his age:
their pride, their ambition, their pomp, their avarice,
their worldly interest, deserved the lashes which
he gave them, both in that, and in most of his
"Canterbury Tales." Neither has his contemporary
Boccace spared them: Yet both those poets lived
in much esteem with good and holy men in orders;
for the scandal which is given by particular priests'
reflects not on the sacred function. Chaucer's
Monk, his Canon, and his Friar, took not from
the character of his Good Parson. A satirical
poet is the check of the laymen on bad priests.
We are only to take care, that we involve not the
innocent with the guilty in the same condemnation.
The good cannot be too much honoured,
nor the bad too coarsely used; for the corruption of
the best becomes the worst. When a clergyman is
whipped, his gown is first taken off, by which the
dignity of his order is secured.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> If he be wrongfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
accused, he has his action of slander; and it is
at the poet's peril if he transgress the law. But
they will tell us, that all kind of satire, though never
so well deserved by particular priests, yet brings
the whole order into contempt. Is then the peerage
of England any thing dishonoured when a peer
suffers for his treason? If he be libelled, or any way
defamed, he has his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandulum magnatum</i> to punish
the offender. They who use this kind of argument,
seem to be conscious to themselves of somewhat
which has deserved the poet's lash, and are less
concerned for their public capacity than for their
private; at least there is pride at the bottom of
their reasoning. If the faults of men in orders are
only to be judged among themselves, they are all in
some sort parties; for, since they say the honour of
their order is concerned in every member of it,
how can we be sure that they will be impartial
judges? How far I may be allowed to speak my
opinion in this case, I know not; but I am sure a
dispute of this nature caused mischief in abundance
betwixt a king of England and an archbishop
of Canterbury;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> one standing up for the
laws of his land, and the other for the honour, as he
called it, of God's church; which ended in the
murder of the prelate, and in the whipping of his
majesty from post to pillar for his penance. The
learned and ingenious Dr Drake<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> has saved me the
labour of enquiring into the esteem and reverence
which the priests have had of old; and I would rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
extend than diminish any part of it: yet I
must needs say, that when a priest provokes me
without any occasion given him, I have no reason,
unless it be the charity of a Christian, to forgive
him: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prior læsit</i> is justification sufficient in the civil
law. If I answer him in his own language, self-defence,
I am sure, must be allowed me; and if I
carry it farther, even to a sharp recrimination, somewhat
may be indulged to human frailty. Yet my
resentment has not wrought so far, but that I have
followed Chaucer in his character of a holy man,
and have enlarged on that subject with some pleasure;
reserving to myself the right, if I shall think
fit hereafter, to describe another sort of priests, such
as are more easily to be found than the Good Parson;
such as have given the last blow to Christianity
in this age, by a practice so contrary to their
doctrine. But this will keep cold till another time.
In the mean while, I take up Chaucer where I left
him.</p>

<p>He must have been a man of a most wonderful
comprehensive nature, because, as it has been truly
observed of him, he has taken into the compass of
his "Canterbury Tales" the various manners and
humours (as we now call them) of the whole English
nation, in his age. Not a single character has
escaped him. All his pilgrims are severally distinguished
from each other; and not only in their inclinations,
but in their very physiognomies and persons.
Baptista Porta<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> could not have described
their natures better, than by the marks which the
poet gives them. The matter and manner of their
tales, and of their telling, are so suited to their different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
educations, humours, and callings, that each
of them would be improper in any other mouth.
Even the grave and serious characters are distinguished
by their several sorts of gravity: their discourses
are such as belong to their age, their calling,
and their breeding; such as are becoming of
them, and of them only. Some of his persons are
vicious, and some virtuous; some are unlearned, or
(as Chaucer calls them) lewd, and some are learned.
Even the ribaldry of the low characters is different:
the Reeve, the Miller, and the Cook, are several
men, and distinguished from each other as much as
the mincing Lady-Prioress and the broad-speaking,
gap-toothed,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Wife of Bath. But enough of this;
there is such a variety of game springing up before
me, that I am distracted in my choice, and know
not which to follow. It is sufficient to say, according
to the proverb, that here is God's plenty. We
have our forefathers and great-grand-dames all before
us, as they were in Chaucer's days: their general
characters are still remaining in mankind, and
even in England, though they are called by other
names than those of monks, and friars, and canons,
and lady-abbesses, and nuns; for mankind is ever
the same, and nothing lost out of nature, though
every thing is altered. May I have leave to do
myself the justice, (since my enemies will do me
none,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and are so far from granting me to be a
good poet, that they will not allow me so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to be a Christian, or a moral man,) may I have
leave, I say, to inform my reader, that I have confined
my choice to such tales of Chaucer as savour
nothing of immodesty. If I had desired more to
please than to instruct, the Reeve, the Miller, the
Shipman, the Merchant, the Sumner, and, above
all, the Wife of Bath, in the prologue to her tale,
would have procured me as many friends and readers,
as there are beaux and ladies of pleasure in the
town. But I will no more offend against good
manners. I am sensible, as I ought to be, of the
scandal I have given by my loose writings; and
make what reparation I am able, by this public acknowledgment.
If any thing of this nature, or of
profaneness, be crept into these poems, I am so far
from defending it, that I disown it, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">totum hoc indictum
volo</i>. Chaucer makes another manner of apology
for his broad speaking, and Boccace makes the
like; but I will follow neither of them. Our countryman,
in the end of his characters, before the
"Canterbury Tales," thus excuses the ribaldry,
which is very gross in many of his novels:</p>

<div class="container">

  <span class="i0">The wordes moste ben cosin to the dede.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet if a man should have inquired of Boccace or
of Chaucer, what need they had of introducing
such characters, where obscene words were proper
in their mouths, but very indecent to be heard? I
know not what answer they could have made; for
that reason, such tale shall be left untold by me.
You have here a specimen of Chaucer's language,
which is so obsolete, that his sense is scarce to be
understood; and you have likewise more than one
example of his unequal numbers, which were mentioned
before. Yet many of his verses consist of
ten syllables, and the words not much behind our
present English: as for example, these two lines,
in the description of the carpenter's young wife:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Winsing she was, as is a jolly colt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have almost done with Chaucer, when I have
answered some objections relating to my present
work. I find some people are offended that I have
turned these tales into modern English; because
they think them unworthy of my pains, and look
on Chaucer as a dry, old-fashioned wit, not worthy
reviving. I have often heard the late Earl of Leicester<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
say, that Mr Cowley himself was of that
opinion; who, having read him over at my lord's request,
declared he had no taste of him. I dare not
advance my opinion against the judgment of so
great an author; but I think it fair, however, to
leave the decision to the public. Mr Cowley was
too modest to set up for a dictator; and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
shocked perhaps with his old style, never examined
into the depth of his good sense. Chaucer, I confess,
is a rough diamond, and must first be polished,
ere he shines. I deny not likewise, that, living
in our early days of poetry, he writes not always of
a piece; but sometimes mingles trivial things with
those of greater moment. Sometimes also, though
not often, he runs riot, like Ovid, and knows not
when he has said enough. But there are more great
wits beside Chaucer, whose fault is their excess of
conceits, and those ill sorted. An author is not to
write all he can, but only all he ought. Having
observed this redundancy in Chaucer, (as it is an
easy matter for a man of ordinary parts to find a
fault in one of greater,) I have not tied myself to a
literal translation; but have often omitted what I
judged unnecessary, or not of dignity enough to
appear in the company of better thoughts. I have
presumed farther, in some places, and added somewhat
of my own where I thought my author was
deficient, and had not given his thoughts their true
lustre, for want of words in the beginning of our
language. And to this I was the more emboldened,
because (if I may be permitted to say it of myself)
I found I had a soul congenial to his, and that
I had been conversant in the same studies. Another
poet, in another age, may take the same liberty
with my writings; if at least they live long
enough to deserve correction. It was also necessary
sometimes to restore the sense of Chaucer,
which was lost or mangled in the errors of the
press. Let this example suffice at present: in the
story of Palamon and Arcite, where the temple of
Diana is described, you find these verses, in all the
editions of our author:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Ther saw I Dane yturned til a tree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I mene not hire the goddesse Diane,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Venus daughter, which that hight Dane.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>which, after a little consideration, I knew was to be
reformed into this sense,&mdash;that Daphne, the daughter
of Peneus, was turned into a tree.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> I durst not
make thus bold with Ovid, lest some future Milbourne
should arise, and say, I varied from my author,
because I understood him not.</p>

<p>But there are other judges, who think I ought
not to have translated Chaucer into English, out of
a quite contrary notion: they suppose there is a
certain veneration due to his old language; and
that it is little less than profanation and sacrilege
to alter it. They are farther of opinion, that somewhat
of his good sense will suffer in this transfusion,
and much of the beauty of his thoughts will
infallibly be lost, which appear with more grace in
their old habit. Of this opinion was that excellent
person, whom I mentioned, the late Earl of Leicester,
who valued Chaucer as much as Mr Cowley
despised him. My lord dissuaded me from this attempt,
(for I was thinking of it some years before
his death,) and his authority prevailed so far with
me, as to defer my undertaking while he lived, in
deference to him: yet my reason was not convinced
with what he urged against it. If the first end of
a writer be to be understood, then, as his language
grows obsolete, his thoughts must grow obscure:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multa renascentur, quæ jam cecidere; cadentque</i></span><br />
  <span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæ nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,</i></span><br />
  <span class="i0"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.</i></span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When an ancient word, for its sound and significancy,
deserves to be revived, I have that reasonable veneration
for antiquity to restore it. All beyond this is
superstition. Words are not like landmarks, so sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
as never to be removed; customs are changed, and
even statutes are silently repealed, when the reason
ceases for which they were enacted. As for the
other part of the argument,&mdash;that his thoughts will
lose of their original beauty by the innovation of
words,&mdash;in the first place, not only their beauty, but
their being is lost, where they are no longer understood,
which is the present case. I grant that something
must be lost in all transfusion, that is, in
all translations; but the sense will remain, which
would otherwise be lost, or at least be maimed,
when it is scarce intelligible, and that but to a
few. How few are there, who can read Chaucer, so
as to understand him perfectly? And if imperfectly,
then with less profit, and no pleasure. It is not
for the use of some old Saxon friends, that I have
taken these pains with him: let them neglect my
version, because they have no need of it. I made
it for their sakes, who understand sense and poetry
as well as they, when that poetry and sense is put
into words which they understand. I will go farther,
and dare to add, that what beauties I lose in
some places, I give to others which had them not
originally: but in this I may be partial to myself;
let the reader judge, and I submit to his decision.
Yet I think I have just occasion to complain of
them, who, because they understand Chaucer, would
deprive the greater part of their countrymen of the
same advantage, and hoard him up, as misers do
their grandam gold, only to look on it themselves,
and hinder others from making use of it. In sum,
I seriously protest, that no man ever had, or can
have, a greater veneration for Chaucer than myself.
I have translated some part of his works, only
that I might perpetuate his memory, or at least refresh
it, amongst my countrymen. If I have altered
him any where for the better, I must at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
same time acknowledge, that I could have done
nothing without him. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Facile est inventis addere</i> is
no great commendation; and I am not so vain to
think I have deserved a greater. I will conclude
what I have to say of him singly, with this one
remark: A lady of my acquaintance, who keeps a
kind of correspondence with some authors of the
fair sex in France, has been informed by them, that
Mademoiselle de Scuderi, who is as old as Sibyl,
and inspired like her by the same god of poetry, is at
this time translating Chaucer into modern French.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
From which I gather, that he has been formerly
translated into the old Provençal; for how she
should come to understand old English, I know
not. But the matter of fact being true, it makes
me think that there is something in it like fatality;
that, after certain periods of time, the fame and
memory of great wits should be renewed, as Chaucer
is both in France and England. If this be
wholly chance, it is extraordinary; and I dare not
call it more, for fear of being taxed with superstition.</p>

<p>Boccace comes last to be considered, who, living
in the same age with Chaucer, had the same genius,
and followed the same studies. Both writ novels,
and each of them cultivated his mother tongue.
But the greatest resemblance of our two modern
authors being in their familiar style, and pleasing
way of relating comical adventures, I may pass it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
over, because I have translated nothing from Boccace
of that nature. In the serious part of poetry,
the advantage is wholly on Chaucer's side; for
though the Englishman has borrowed many tales
from the Italian, yet it appears, that those of Boccace
were not generally of his own making, but
taken from authors of former ages, and by him only
modelled; so that what there was of invention, in
either of them, may be judged equal. But Chaucer
has refined on Boccace, and has mended the
stories, which he has borrowed, in his way of telling;
though prose allows more liberty of thought,
and the expression is more easy when unconfined
by numbers. Our countryman carries weight, and
yet wins the race at disadvantage. I desire not the
reader should take my word; and, therefore, I will
set two of their discourses, on the same subject, in
the same light, for every man to judge betwixt
them. I translated Chaucer first, and, amongst the
rest, pitched on the "Wife of Bath's Tale;" not daring,
as I have said, to adventure on her prologue,
because it is too licentious.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> There Chaucer introduces
an old woman, of mean parentage, whom a
youthful knight, of noble blood, was forced to
marry, and consequently loathed her. The crone,
being in bed with him, on the wedding-night, and
finding his aversion, endeavours to win his affection
by reason, and speaks a good word for herself,
(as who could blame her?) in hope to mollify the
sullen bridegroom. She takes her topics from the
benefits of poverty, the advantages of old age and
ugliness, the vanity of youth, and the silly pride
of ancestry and titles, without inherent virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
which is the true nobility. When I had closed
Chaucer, I returned to Ovid, and translated some
more of his fables; and, by this time, had so far forgotten
the "Wife of Bath's Tale," that, when I took
up Boccace, unawares I fell on the same argument,
of preferring virtue to nobility of blood and titles,
in the story of Sigismunda; which I had certainly
avoided, for the resemblance of the two discourses,
if my memory had not failed me. Let the reader
weigh them both; and, if he thinks me partial to
Chaucer, it is in him to right Boccace.</p>

<p>I prefer, in our countryman, far above all his
other stories, the noble poem of "Palamon and Arcite,"
which is of the epic kind, and perhaps not
much inferior to the Ilias, or the Æneis. The story
is more pleasing than either of them, the manners
as perfect, the diction as poetical, the learning as
deep and various, and the disposition full as artful,
only it includes a greater length of time, as taking
up seven years at least: but Aristotle has left undecided
the duration of the action, which yet is
easily reduced into the compass of a year, by a narration
of what preceded the return of Palamon to
Athens. I had thought, for the honour of our nation,
and more particularly for his, whose laurel,
though unworthy, I have worn after him, that this
story was of English growth, and Chaucer's own:
but I was undeceived by Boccace; for, casually
looking on the end of his seventh Giornata, I found
Dioneo (under which name he shadows himself,)
and Fiametta, (who represents his mistress, the natural
daughter of Robert, king of Naples,) of whom
these words are spoken:&mdash;"<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dioneo e Fiametta
gran pezza Eantarono insieme d'Arcita, e di Palemone</i>;"
by which it appears, that this story was
written before the time of Boccace; but the name
of its author being wholly lost, Chaucer is now become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
an original; and I question not but the poem
has received many beauties, by passing through his
noble hands.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Besides this tale, there is another of
his own invention, after the manner of the Provençals,
called "The Flower and the Leaf," with
which I was so particularly pleased, both for the
invention and the moral, that I cannot hinder myself
from recommending it to the reader.</p>

<p>As a corollary to this preface, in which I have
done justice to others, I owe somewhat to myself;
not that I think it worth my time to enter the lists
with one Milbourne, and one Blackmore, but barely
to take notice, that such men there are, who have
written scurrilously against me, without any provocation.
Milbourne, who is in orders, pretends,
amongst the rest, this quarrel to me, that I have
fallen foul on priesthood: if I have, I am only to
ask pardon of good priests, and am afraid his part
of the reparation will come to little.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Let him be
satisfied, that he shall not be able to force himself
upon me for an adversary. I contemn him too
much to enter into competition with him. His own
translations of Virgil have answered his criticisms
on mine. If, as they say, he has declared in print,
he prefers the version of Ogilby to mine, the world
has made him the same compliment; for it is
agreed, on all hands, that he writes even below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Ogilby. That, you will say, is not easily to be
done; but what cannot Milbourne bring about? I
am satisfied, however, that, while he and I live together,
I shall not be thought the worst poet of the
age. It looks, as if I had desired him, underhand,
to write so ill against me; but, upon my honest
word, I have not bribed him to do me this service,
and am wholly guiltless of his pamphlet. It is
true, I should be glad if I could persuade him to
continue his good offices, and write such another
critique on any thing of mine; for I find, by experience,
he has a great stroke with the reader, when
he condemns any of my poems, to make the world
have a better opinion of them. He has taken some
pains with my poetry; but nobody will be persuaded
to take the same with his. If I had taken to
the church, as he affirms, but which was never in
my thoughts, I should have had more sense, if not
more grace, than to have turned myself out of my
benefice, by writing libels on my parishioners. But
his account of my manners, and my principles, is
of a piece with his cavils and his poetry; and so I
have done with him for ever.</p>

<p>As for the City Bard, or Knight Physician, I
hear his quarrel to me is, that I was the author of
"Absalom and Achitophel," which, he thinks, is a
little hard on his fanatic patrons in London.</p>

<p>But I will deal the more civilly with his two
poems, because nothing ill is to be spoken of the
dead; and, therefore, peace be to the manes of his
"Arthurs."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> I will only say, that it was not for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
noble knight that I drew the plan of an epic poem
on King Arthur, in my preface to the translation of
Juvenal. The guardian angels of kingdoms were
machines too ponderous for him to manage; and
therefore he rejected them, as Dares did the whirlbats
of Eryx, when they were thrown before him
by Entellus: yet from that preface, he plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
took his hint; for he began immediately upon the
story, though he had the baseness not to acknowledge
his benefactor, but, instead of it, to traduce
me in a libel.</p>

<p>I shall say the less of Mr Collier, because in
many things he has taxed me justly; and I have
pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of
mine, which can be truly argued of obscenity, profaneness,
or immorality, and retract them. If he
be my enemy, let him triumph; if he be my friend,
as I have given him no personal occasion to be
otherwise, he will be glad of my repentance. It
becomes me not to draw my pen in the defence of
a bad cause, when I have so often drawn it for a
good one. Yet it were not difficult to prove, that,
in many places, he has perverted my meaning by
his glosses, and interpreted my words into blasphemy
and bawdry, of which they were not guilty; besides,
that he is too much given to horse-play in
his raillery, and comes to battle like a dictator from
the plough. I will not say, "the zeal of God's
house has eaten him up;" but I am sure it has devoured
some part of his good manners and civility.
It might also be doubted, whether it were altogether
zeal which prompted him to this rough manner
of proceeding; perhaps, it became not one of
his function to rake into the rubbish of ancient and
modern plays: a divine might have employed his
pains to better purpose, than in the nastiness of
Plautus and Aristophanes, whose examples, as they
excuse not me, so it might be possibly supposed,
that he read them not without some pleasure.
They, who have written commentaries on those
poets, or on Horace, Juvenal, and Martial, have explained
some vices, which, without their interpretation,
had been unknown to modern times. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
has he judged impartially betwixt the former age and
us. There is more bawdry in one play of Fletcher's,
called "The Custom of the Country," than in all
ours together.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Yet this has been often acted on
the stage, in my remembrance. Are the times so
much more reformed now, than they were five-and-twenty
years ago? If they are, I congratulate the
amendment of our morals. But I am not to prejudice
the cause of my fellow poets, though I abandon
my own defence: they have some of them answered
for themselves; and neither they nor I can
think Mr Collier so formidable an enemy, that we
should shun him. He has lost ground, at the latter
end of the day, by pursuing his point too far,
like the Prince of Condé, at the battle of Senneph:<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
from immoral plays, to no plays, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab abusu ad usum,
non valet consequentia</i>. But, being a party, I am
not to erect myself into a judge. As for the rest
of those who have written against me, they are
such scoundrels, that they deserve not the least notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
to be taken of them. Blackmore and Milbourne
are only distinguished from the crowd, by
being remembered to their infamy:</p>

<h3>PALAMON AND ARCITE;<br />

<br />
THE KNIGHT'S TALE.</h3>

<h2>PALAMON AND ARCITE.</h2>


<p>"The Knight's Tale," whether we consider Chaucer's original
poem, or the spirited and animated version of Dryden, is one of
the finest pieces of composition in our language. We have treated
of its merits so amply in the general criticism on Dryden's poetry,
that little remains here save to trace the antiquity of the fable.</p>

<p>The history of Theseus, as, indeed, it is a sort of legend of
knight-errantry, was an early favourite during the middle ages.
It is probable, that the anecdote of Palamon and Arcite was
early engrafted upon the story of the siege of Thebes. But the
original from which Chaucer appears to have immediately derived
his materials, is the "Teseide" of Boccacio, an epic poem, composed
in <i>ottava rima</i>, of which Tyrwhitt has given an analysis. The work
of Chaucer cannot, however, properly be termed a translation;
on the contrary, the tale has acquired its most beautiful passages
under the hand of the English bard. He abridged the prolix, and
enlarged the poetical, parts of the work; compressed the whole
into one concise and interesting tale; and left us an example of
a beautiful heroic poem, if a work is entitled to that name which
consists only of two thousand lines.</p>

<p>This romantic legend is, by Chaucer, with great propriety, put
into the mouth of the Knight, a distinguished character among
the Pilgrims; who, in their journey to the shrine of St Thomas at
Canterbury, had agreed to beguile the way by telling each a tale
in turn. Hence the second title of "The Knight's Tale."</p>

<h4>BOOK I.</h4>

<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> days of old, there lived, of mighty fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A valiant prince, and Theseus was his name;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A chief, who more in feats of arms excelled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rising nor the setting sun beheld.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of Athens he was lord; much land he won,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And added foreign countries to his crown.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom first by force he conquered, then by love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With whom her sister, fair Emilia, came.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With honour to his home let Theseus ride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With love to friend, and fortune for his guide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And his victorious army at his side.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I pass their warlike pomp, their proud array,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their shouts, their songs, their welcome on the way;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But, were it not too long, I would recite</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The feats of Amazons, the fatal fight</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Betwixt the hardy queen, and hero knight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The town besieged, and how much blood it cost</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The female army, and the Athenian host;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The spousals of Hippolita the queen;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The storm at their return, the ladies' fear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But these, and other things, I must forbear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The field is spacious I design to sow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With oxen far unfit to draw the plow:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The remnant of my tale is of a length</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To tire your patience, and to waste my strength;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And trivial accidents shall be forborne,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That others may have time to take their turn;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As was at first enjoined us by mine host,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That he whose tale is best, and pleases most,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Should win his supper at our common cost.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And therefore where I left, I will pursue</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This ancient story, whether false or true,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In hope it may be mended with a new.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The prince I mentioned, full of high renown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In this array drew near the Athenian town;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When in his pomp and utmost of his pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Marching, he chanced to cast his eye aside,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And saw a choir of mourning dames, who lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By two and two, across the common way:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At his approach they raised a rueful cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And beat their breasts, and held their hands on high;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Creeping and crying, till they seized at last,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His courser's bridle, and his feet embraced.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Tell me, said Theseus, what and whence you are,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And why this funeral pageant you prepare?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To meet my triumph, in ill-omened weeds?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Or envy you my praise, and would destroy</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With grief my pleasures, and pollute my joy?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or are you injured, and demand relief?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Name your request, and I will ease your grief.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The most in years, of all the mourning train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Began; but swooned first away for pain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, scarce recovered, spoke;&mdash;Nor envy we</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy great renown, nor grudge thy victory:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis thine, O king, the afflicted to redress,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And fame has filled the world with thy success:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We wretched women sue for that alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which of thy goodness is refused to none;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Let fall some drops of pity on our grief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If what we beg be just, and we deserve relief;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For none of us, who now thy grace implore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But held the rank of sovereign queen before;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till, thanks to giddy chance, which never bears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That mortal bliss should last for length of years,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She cast us headlong from our high estate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And here in hope of thy return we wait;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And long have waited in the temple nigh,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Built to the gracious goddess Clemency.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But reverence thou the power, whose name it bears;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Relieve the oppressed, and wipe the widow's tears.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I, wretched I, have other fortune seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wife of Capaneus, and once a queen:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At Thebes he fell; curst be the fatal day!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all the rest thou seest in this array,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To make their moan, their lords in battle lost</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before that town besieged by our confederate host;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Creon, old and impious, who commands</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The Theban city, and usurps the lands,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Denies the rites of funeral fires to those</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unburned, unburied, on a heap they lie;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such is their fate, and such his tyranny;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">No friend has leave to bear away the dead,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At this she shrieked aloud; the mournful train</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Echoed her grief, and, grovelling on the plain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With groans, and hands upheld, to move his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Besought his pity to their helpless kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The prince was touched, his tears began to flow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as his tender heart would break in two,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He sighed; and could not but their fate deplore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So wretched now, so fortunate before.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And raising one by one the suppliant crew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To comfort each, full solemnly he swore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">"That, by the faith which knights to knighthood bore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And whate'er else to chivalry belongs,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would not cease, till he revenged their wrongs;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That Greece should see performed what he declared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cruel Creon find his just reward."&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He said no more, but, shunning all delay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rode on, nor entered Athens on his way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But left his sister and his queen behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And waved his royal banner in the wind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where, in an argent field, the god of war</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was drawn triumphant on his iron car;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Red was his sword, and shield, and whole attire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all the godhead seemed to glow with fire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even the ground glittered where the standard flew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">High on his pointed lance, his pennon bore<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">His Cretan fight, the conquered Minotaur:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The soldiers shout around with generous rage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in that victory their own presage.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He praised their ardour; inly pleased to see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His host the flower of Grecian chivalry.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All day he marched, and all the ensuing night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And saw the city with returning light.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The process of the war I need not tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How Theseus conquered, and how Creon fell;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or after, how by storm the walls were won,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or how the victor sacked and burned the town;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How to the ladies he restored again</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bodies of their lords in battle slain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with what ancient rites they were interred,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All these to fitter times shall be deferred:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I spare the widows' tears, their woful cries,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And howling at their husbands' obsequies;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How Theseus at these funerals did assist,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with what gifts the mourning dames dismissed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus when the victor-chief had Creon slain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And conquered Thebes, he pitched upon the plain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His mighty camp, and, when the day returned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The country wasted, and the hamlets burned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And left the pillagers, to rapine bred,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Without controul, to strip and spoil the dead.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">There, in a heap of slain, among the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of slaughtered foes, whom first to death they sent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The trophies of their strength, a bloody monument.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both fair, and both of royal blood they seemed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemed;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">That day in equal arms they fought for fame;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their swords, their shields, their surcoats, were the same.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Close by each other laid, they pressed the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But some faint signs of feeble life appear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wandring breath was on the wing to part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Weak was the pulse, and hardly heaved the heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These two were sister's sons; and Arcite one,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Much famed in fields, with valiant Palamon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From these their costly arms the spoilers rent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And softly both conveyed to Theseus' tent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom, known of Creon's line, and cured with care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He to his city sent as prisoners of the war,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hopeless of ransom, and condemned to lie</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In durance, doomed a lingering death to die.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This done, he marched away with warlike sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And to his Athens turned with laurels crowned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where happy long he lived, much loved, and more renowned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in a tower, and never to be loosed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The woful captive kinsmen are inclosed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus year by year they pass, and day by day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till once,&mdash;'twas on the morn of cheerful May,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The young Emilia, fairer to be seen</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than the fair lily on the flowery green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More fresh than May herself in blossoms new,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For with the rosy colour strove her hue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Waked, as her custom was, before the day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To do the observance due to sprightly May;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sprightly May commands our youth to keep</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The vigils of her night, and breaks their sluggard sleep;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Inspires new flames, revives extinguished loves.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">In this remembrance, Emily, ere day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arose, and dressed herself in rich array;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fresh as the month, and as the morning fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A ribband did the braided tresses bind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rest was loose, and wantoned in the wind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Aurora had but newly chased the night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When to the garden walk she took her way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To sport and trip along in cool of day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And offer maiden vows in honour of the May.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At every turn she made a little stand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thrust among the thorns her lily hand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To draw the rose, and every rose she drew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She shook the stalk, and brushed away the dew;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then party-coloured flowers of white and red</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She wove, to make a garland for her head</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This done, she sung and carolled out so clear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That men and angels might rejoice to hear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And learned from her to welcome in the spring.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tower, of which before was mention made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Within whose keep the captive knights were laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Built of a large extent, and strong withal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was one partition of the palace wall;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The garden was enclosed within the square,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where young Emilia took the morning-air.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">It happened Palamon, the prisoner knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Restless for woe, arose before the light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with his jailor's leave desired to breathe</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An air more wholesome than the damps beneath.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This granted, to the tower he took his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cheered with the promise of a glorious day;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then cast a languishing regard around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And saw, with hateful eyes, the temples crowned</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With golden spires, and all the hostile ground.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">He sighed, and turned his eyes, because he knew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas but a larger jail he had in view;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then looked below, and from the castle's height</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The garden, which before he had not seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In spring's new livery clad with white and green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fresh flowers in wide parterres, and shady walks between.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This viewed, but not enjoyed, with arms across</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He stood, reflecting on his country's loss;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Himself an object of the public scorn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And often wished he never had been born.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At last, for so his destiny required,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With walking giddy, and with thinking tired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He through a little window cast his sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though thick of bars, that gave a scanty light;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But even that glimmering served him to descry</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The inevitable charms of Emily.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Scarce had he seen, but, seized with sudden smart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stung to the quick, he felt it to his heart;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Struck blind with overpowering light, he stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then started back amazed, and cried aloud.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Young Arcite heard, and up he ran with haste,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To help his friend, and in his arms embraced;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And asked him why he looked so deadly wan,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And whence and how his change of cheer began?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or who had done the offence? "But if," said he,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">"Your grief alone is hard captivity;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For love of heaven with patience undergo</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A cureless ill, since fate will have it so:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So stood our horoscope in chains to lie,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or other baleful aspect, ruled our birth,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When all the friendly stars were under earth:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whate'er betides, by destiny 'tis done;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And better bear like men, than vainly seek to shun.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Nor of my bonds, said Palamon again,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor of unhappy planets, I complain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when my mortal anguish caused my cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That moment I was hurt through either eye;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pierced with a random shaft, I faint away,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And perish with insensible decay:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A glance of some new goddess gave the wound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom, like Acteon, unaware I found.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Look how she walks along yon shady space!</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not Juno moves with more majestic grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And all the Cyprian queen is in her face.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If thou art Venus, (for thy charms confess,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That face was formed in heaven, nor art thou less;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Disguised in habit, undisguised in shape,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O help us captives from our chains to 'scape!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But if our doom be past in bonds to lie</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For life, and in a loathsome dungeon die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And shew compassion to the Theban race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Oppressed by tyrant power!"&mdash;While yet he spoke,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite on Emily had fixed his look;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fatal dart a ready passage found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And deep within his heart infixed the wound:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So that if Palamon were wounded sore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite was hurt as much as he, or more:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then from his inmost soul he sighed, and said,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The beauty I behold has struck me dead:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unknowingly she strikes, and kills by chance;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Poison is in her eyes, and death in every glance.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O, I must; nor ask alone, but move</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her mind to mercy, or must die for love.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus Arcite: And thus Palamon replies,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Eager his tone, and ardent were his eyes,)</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Speak'st thou in earnest, or in jesting vein?</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jesting, said Arcite, suits but ill with pain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It suits far worse, (said Palamon again,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And bent his brows,) with men who honour weigh,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their faith to break, their friendship to betray;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But worst with thee, of noble lineage born,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My kinsman, and in arms my brother sworn.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Have we not plighted each our holy oath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That one should be the common good of both;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One soul should both inspire, and neither prove</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His fellow's hindrance in pursuit of love?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To this before the gods we gave our hands,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And nothing but our death can break the bands.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This binds thee, then, to further my design,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As I am bound by vow to further thine:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor canst, nor dar'st thou, traitor, on the plain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Appeach my honour, or thy own maintain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since thou art of my council, and the friend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose faith I trust, and on whose care depend.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wouldst thou court my lady's love, which I</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Much rather than release would choose to die?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But thou, false Arcite, never shalt obtain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy bad pretence; I told thee first my pain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For first my love began ere thine was born;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou, as my council, and my brother sworn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Art bound to assist my eldership of right,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or justly to be deemed a perjured knight.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus Palamon: But Arcite, with disdain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In haughty language, thus replied again,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forsworn thyself: the traitor's odious name</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I first return, and then disprove thy claim.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If love be passion, and that passion nurst</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With strong desires, I loved the lady first.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Canst thou pretend desire, whom zeal inflamed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To worship, and a power celestial named?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thine was devotion to the blest above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I saw the woman, and desired her love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">First owned my passion, and to thee commend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The important secret, as my chosen friend.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Suppose (which yet I grant not) thy desire</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A moment elder than my rival fire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Can chance of seeing first thy title prove?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And know'st thou not, no law is made for love?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Law is to things which to free choice relate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love is not in our choice, but in our fate:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Laws are but positive; love's power, we see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is nature's sanction, and her first decree.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each day we break the bond of human laws</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For love, and vindicate the common cause.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Laws for defence of civil rights are placed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love throws the fences down, and makes a general waste:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Maids, widows, wives, without distinction fall;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sweeping deluge, love, comes on, and covers all.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If then the laws of friendship I transgress,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I keep the greater, while I break the less;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And both are mad alike, since neither can possess.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both hopeless to be ransomed, never more</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To see the sun, but as he passes o'er.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Like Æsop's hounds contending for the bone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each pleaded right, and would be lord alone:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fruitless fight continued all the day;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A cur came by, and snatched the prize away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As courtiers therefore jostle for a grant,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And when they break their friendship, plead their want;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So thou, if fortune will thy suit advance,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love on, nor envy me my equal chance:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For I must love, and am resolved to try</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My fate, or, failing in the adventure, die.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Great was their strife, which hourly was renewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till each with mortal hate his rival viewed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now friends no more, nor walking hand in hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when they met, they made a surly stand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And glared like angry lions as they passed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wished that every look might be their last.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">It chanced at length, Perithous came, to attend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This worthy Theseus, his familiar friend:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their love in early infancy began,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And rose as childhood ripened into man,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Companions of the war; and loved so well,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That when one died, as ancient stories tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His fellow to redeem him went to hell.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But to pursue my tale; to welcome home</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His warlike brother, is Perithous come:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And honoured by this young Thessalian prince.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Theseus, to gratify his friend and guest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who made our Arcite's freedom his request,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Restored to liberty the captive knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But on these hard conditions I recite:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That if hereafter Arcite should be found</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Within the compass of Athenian ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By day or night, or on whate'er pretence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His head should pay the forfeit of the offence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To this Perithous for his friend agreed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And on his promise was the prisoner freed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At his own peril; for his life must pay.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Finds his dear purchase, and repents too late?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What have I gained, he said, in prison pent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If I but change my bonds for banishment?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And banished from her sight, I suffer more</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In freedom, than I felt in bonds before;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forced from her presence, and condemned to live,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unwelcome freedom, and unthanked reprieve:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Heaven is not, but where Emily abides,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And where she's absent, all is hell besides.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Next to my day of birth, was that accurst,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which bound my friendship to Perithous first:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had I not known that prince, I still had been</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In bondage, and had still Emilia seen:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">For though I never can her grace deserve,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis recompence enough to see and serve.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O Palamon, my kinsman and my friend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How much more happy fates thy love attend!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thine is the adventure; thine the victory;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well has thy fortune turned the dice for thee:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou on that angel's face may'st feed thine eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In prison, no; but blissful paradise!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And lov'st at least in love's extremest line.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I mourn in absence, love's eternal night;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And who can tell but since thou hast her sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And art a comely, young, and valiant knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fortune (a various power) may cease to frown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, by some ways unknown, thy wishes crown?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But I, the most forlorn of human kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor help can hope, nor remedy can find;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But doomed to drag my loathsome life in care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For my reward, must end it in despair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fire, water, air, and earth, and force of fates,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That governs all, and heaven that all creates,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor art, nor nature's hand can ease my grief;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nothing but death, the wretch's last relief:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then farewell youth, and all the joys that dwell</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With youth and life, and life itself, farewell!</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But why, alas! do mortal men in vain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of fortune, fate, or Providence, complain?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">God gives us what he knows our wants require,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And better things than those which we desire:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some pray for riches; riches they obtain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, watched by robbers, for their wealth are slain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some pray from prison to be freed; and come,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When guilty of their vows, to fall at home;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Murdered by those they trusted with their life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A favoured servant, or a bosom wife.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such dear-bought blessings happen every day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because we know not for what things to pray.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Like drunken sots about the streets we roam;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well knows the sot he has a certain home,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And blunders on, and staggers every pace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus all seek happiness; but few can find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For far the greater part of men are blind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This is my case, who thought our utmost good</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was in one word of freedom understood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fatal blessing came; from prison free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I starve abroad, and lose the sight of Emily.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus Arcite; but if Arcite thus deplore</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His sufferings, Palamon yet suffers more.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For when he knew his rival freed and gone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He swells with wrath, he makes outrageous moan,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the ground;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The hollow tower with clamours rings around:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With briny tears he bathed his fettered feet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And dropped all o'er with agony of sweat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alas! he cried, I, wretch! in prison pine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Too happy rival, while the fruit is thine:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou liv'st at large, thou draw'st thy native air,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pleased with thy freedom, proud of my despair:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou may'st, since thou hast youth and courage joined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sweet behaviour and a solid mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Assemble ours, and all the Theban race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And after, by some treaty made, possess</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fair Emily, the pledge of lasting peace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So thine shall be the beauteous prize, while I</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Must languish in despair, in prison die.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy portion double joys, and double sorrows mine.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The rage of jealousy then fired his soul,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And his face kindled like a burning coal:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now cold despair, succeeding in her stead,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To livid paleness turns the glowing red.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">His blood, scarce liquid, creeps within his veins,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like water which the freezing wind constrains.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then thus he said:&mdash;Eternal deities,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who rule the world with absolute decrees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And write whatever time shall bring to pass,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With pens of adamant, on plates of brass;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What, is the race of human kind your care</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He with the rest is liable to pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And like the sheep, his brother-beast, is slain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cold, hunger, prisons, ills without a cure,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All these he must, and, guiltless, oft endure;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or does your justice, power, or presence fail,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When the good suffer, and the bad prevail?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What worse to wretched virtue could befal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If fate or giddy fortune governed all?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nay, worse than other beasts is our estate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Them, to pursue their pleasures, you create;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We, bound by harder laws, must curb our will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And your commands, not our desires, fulfil:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then when the creature is unjustly slain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet, after death at least, he feels no pain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But man, in life surcharged with woe before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not freed when dead, is doomed to suffer more.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A serpent shoots his sting at unaware;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An ambushed thief forelays a traveller;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The man lies murdered, while the thief and snake,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One gains the thickets, and one thrids the brake.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This let divines decide; but well I know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Just, or unjust, I have my share of woe:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through Saturn seated in a luckless place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Juno's wrath, that persecutes my race;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or Mars and Venus, in a quartil, move</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My pangs of jealousy for Arcite's love.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Let Palamon oppressed in bondage mourn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While to his exiled rival we return.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">By this, the sun, declining from his height,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The day had shortened to prolong the night:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The lengthened night gave length of misery,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both to the captive lover and the free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For Palamon in endless prison mourns,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Arcite forfeits life if he returns.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The banished never hopes his love to see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis hard to say who suffers greater pains;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One sees his love, but cannot break his chains;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One free, and all his motions uncontrouled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beholds whate'er he would, but what he would behold.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Judge as you please, for I will haste to tell</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What fortune to the banished knight befel.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">When Arcite was to Thebes returned again,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The loss of her he loved renewed his pain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What could be worse, than never more to see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His life, his soul, his charming Emily?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He raved with all the madness of despair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He roared, he beat his breast, he tore his hair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, wanting nourishment, he wanted tears:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His eye-balls in their hollow sockets sink,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bereft of sleep; he loaths his meat and drink.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He withers at his heart, and looks as wan</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As the pale spectre of a murdered man:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That pale turns yellow, and his face receives</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">In solitary groves he makes his moan,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Walks early out, and ever is alone:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor, mixed in mirth, in youthful pleasures shares,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sighs when songs and instruments he hears.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His spirits are so low, his voice is drowned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He hears as from afar, or in a swoon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Uncombed his locks, and squalid his attire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unlike the trim of love and gay desire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But full of museful mopings, which presage</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The loss of reason, and conclude in rage.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This when he had endured a year and more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now wholly changed from what he was before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It happened once, that, slumbering as he lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He dreamed, (his dream began at break of day,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That Hermes o'er his head in air appeared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with soft words his drooping spirits cheered:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His hat, adorned with wings, disclosed the God,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as he seemed, when, at his sire's command,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On Argus' head he laid the snaky wand.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arise, he said, to conquering Athens go,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There fate appoints an end of all thy woe.&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fright awakened Arcite with a start,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But soon he said, with scarce-recovered breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thither will I go, to meet my death,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sure to be slain; but death is my desire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since in Emilia's sight I shall expire.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And gazing there beheld his altered look;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wondering, he saw his features and his hue</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So much were changed, that scarce himself he knew.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">A sudden thought then starting in his mind,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The world may search in vain with all their eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But never penetrate through this disguise.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In low estate I may securely live,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And see, unknown, my mistress day by day.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He said, and clothed himself in coarse array;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A labouring hind in shew: then forth he went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And to the Athenian towers his journey bent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One squire attended in the same disguise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made conscious of his master's enterprize.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arrived at Athens, soon he came to court,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unknown, unquestioned in that thick resort;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proffering for hire his service at the gate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To drudge, draw water, and to run or wait.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">So fair befel him, that for little gain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He served at first Emilia's chamberlain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, watchful all advantages to spy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was still at hand, and in his master's eye;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as his bones were big, and sinews strong,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Refused no toil that could to slaves belong;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But from deep wells with engines water drew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And used his noble hands the wood to hew.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He passed a year at least attending thus</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On Emily, and called Philostratus.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But never was there man of his degree</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So much esteemed, so well beloved as he.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So gentle of condition was he known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That through the court his courtesy was blown:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All think him worthy of a greater place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And recommend him to the royal grace;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">That, exercised within a higher sphere,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His virtues more conspicuous might appear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And by great Theseus to high favour raised;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Among his menial servants first enrolled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And largely entertained with sums of gold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of his own income, and his annual rent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This well employed, he purchased friends and fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But cautiously concealed from whence it came.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus for three years he lived with large increase,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In arms of honour, and esteem in peace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To Theseus' person he was ever near,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Theseus for his virtues held him dear.</span><br />

<p class="p2">OR,</p>

<p class="p1">THE KNIGHT'S TALE.</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">W</span>&nbsp; <span class="smcap">hile</span> Arcite lives in bliss, the story turns</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For six long years immured, the captive knight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had dragged his chains, and scarcely seen the light:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lost liberty and love at once he bore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His prison pained him much, his passion more;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor ever wishes to be free from love.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But when the sixth revolving year was run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And May, within the Twins, received the sun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were it by chance, or forceful destiny,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Assisted by a friend, one moonless night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This Palamon from prison took his flight.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">A pleasant beverage he prepared before</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of wine and honey, mixed with added store</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of opium; to his keeper this he brought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who swallowed, unaware, the sleepy draught,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And snored secure till morn, his senses bound</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In slumber, and in long oblivion drowned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Short was the night, and careful Palamon</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sought the next covert ere the rising sun.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A thick-spread forest near the city lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To this, with lengthened strides, he took his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(For far he could not fly, and feared the day.)</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Safe from pursuit, he meant to shun the light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Till the brown shadows of the friendly night</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To Thebes might favour his intended flight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When to his country come, his next design</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was all the Theban race in arms to join,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And war on Theseus, till he lost his life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or won the beauteous Emily to wife.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To gentle Arcite let us turn our style;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The morning lark, the messenger of day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Saluted, in her song, the morning gray;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And soon the sun arose with beams so bright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That all the horizon laughed to see the joyous sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He, with his tepid rays, the rose renews,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And licks the drooping leaves, and dries the dews;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When Arcite left his bed, resolved to pay</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Observance to the month of merry May:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forth, on his fiery steed, betimes he rode,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At ease he seemed, and, prancing o'er the plains,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Turned only to the grove his horse's reins,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(The grove I named before,) and lighting there,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Then turned his face against the rising day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And raised his voice to welcome in the May:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">For thee, sweet month, the groves green liveries wear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If not the first, the fairest, of the year:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Nature's ready pencil paints the flowers:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When thy short reign is past, the feverish sun</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor goats, with venomed teeth, thy tendrils bite,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind.&mdash;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His vows addressed, within the grove he strayed,&nbsp;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Till Fate, or Fortune, near the place conveyed</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His steps where secret Palamon was laid.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Full little thought of him the gentle knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who, flying death, had there concealed his flight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In brakes and brambles hid, and shunning mortal sight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And less he knew him for his hated foe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But feared him as a man he did not know.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But as it has been said of ancient years,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That fields are full of eyes, and woods have ears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this the wise are ever on their guard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, unforeseen, they say, is unprepared.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And less than all suspected Palamon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, listening, heard him, while he searched the grove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And loudly sung his roundelay of love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But on the sudden stopped, and silent stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As lovers often muse, and change their mood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now high as heaven, and then as low as hell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now up, now down, as buckets in a well:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For Venus, like her day, will change her cheer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And seldom shall we see a Friday clear.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Thus Arcite having sung, with altered hue</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sunk on the ground, and from his bosom drew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A desperate sigh, accusing Heaven and Fate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And angry Juno's unrelenting hate:&mdash;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cursed be the day when first I did appear!</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let it be blotted from the calendar,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lest it pollute the month, and poison all the year.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still will the jealous queen pursue our race?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cadmus is dead, the Theban city was:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet ceases not her hate; for all, who come</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From Cadmus, are involved in Cadmus' doom.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I suffer for my blood: unjust decree!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That punishes another's crime on me.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In mean estate, I serve my mortal foe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The man who caused my country's overthrow.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is not all; for Juno, to my shame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Has forced me to forsake my former name;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arcite I was, Philostratus I am.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That side of heaven is all my enemy;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mars ruined Thebes; his mother<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> ruined me.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of all the royal race remains but one,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Besides myself, the unhappy Palamon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom Theseus holds in bonds, and will not free;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Without a crime, except his kin to me.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet these, and all the rest, I could endure;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But love's a malady without a cure:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fierce Love has pierced me with his fiery dart;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He fries within, and hisses at my heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your eyes, fair Emily, my fate pursue;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I suffer for the rest, I die for you.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of such a goddess no time leaves record,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who burned the temple where she was adored:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And let it burn, I never will complain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pleased with my sufferings, if you knew my pain.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At this, a sickly qualm his heart assailed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His ears ring inward, and his senses failed.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">No word missed Palamon, of all he spoke;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But soon to deadly pale he changed his look:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He trembled every limb, and felt a smart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if cold steel had glided through his heart;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor longer staid, but, starting from his place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Discovered stood, and shewed his hostile face:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">False traitor, Arcite, traitor to thy blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now art thou found forsworn, for Emily,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And darest attempt her love, for whom I die.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Against thy vow, returning to beguile</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Under a borrowed name: as false to me,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So false thou art to him, who set thee free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But rest assured, that either thou shalt die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or else renounce thy claim in Emily;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, though unarmed I am, and (freed by chance)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Am here without my sword, or pointed lance,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hope not, base man, unquestioned hence to go,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Arcite, who heard his tale, and knew the man,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His sword unsheathed, and fiercely thus began:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now, by the gods, who govern heaven above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wert thou not weak with hunger, mad with love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That word had been thy last; or, in this grove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This hand should force thee to renounce thy love!</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The surety, which I gave thee, I defy:</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fool, not to know, that love endures no tie,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And Jove but laughs at lovers' perjury!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Know, I will serve the fair in thy despite;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, since thou art my kinsman, and a knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Here, have my faith, to-morrow, in this grove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Our arms shall plead the titles of our love:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And heaven so help my right, as I alone</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Will come, and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">With arms of proof, both for myself and thee;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Choose thou the best, and leave the worst to me.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, that at better ease thou may'st abide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bedding and clothes I will this night provide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And needful sustenance, that thou may'st be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A conquest better won, and worthy me.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His promise Palamon accepts; but prayed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To keep it better than the first he made.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus fair they parted till the morrow's dawn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Oh Love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This was in Arcite proved and Palamon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both in despair, yet each would love alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite returned, and, as in honour tied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His foe with bedding, and with food, supplied;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, ere the day, two suits of armour sought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which, borne before him, on his steed he brought;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both were of shining steel, and wrought so pure,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As might the strokes of two such arms endure.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now at the time, and in the appointed place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The challenger and challenged, face to face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Approach; each other, from afar, they knew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from afar their hatred changed their hue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So stands the Thracian herdsman, with his spear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Full in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And hears him rustling in the wood, and sees</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His course, at distance, by the bending trees;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thinks, here comes my mortal enemy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And either he must fall in fight, or I:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This while he thinks, he lifts aloft his dart;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A generous chillness seizes every part;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The veins pour back the blood, and fortify the heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus pale they meet; their eyes with fury burn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">None greets, for none the greeting will return;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">But in dumb surliness, each armed, with care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His foe profest, as brother of the war:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then both, no moment lost, at once advance</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Against each other, armed with sword and lance.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They lash, they foin, they pass, they strive to bore</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their corslets, and the thinnest parts explore.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus two long hours, in equal arms, they stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, wounded, wound, till both were bathed in blood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And not a foot of ground had either got,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if the world depended on the spot.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fell Arcite like an angry tyger fared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And like a lion Palamon appeared:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or, as two boars, whom love to battle draws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With rising bristles, and with frothy jaws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With grunts and groans the forest rings around.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So fought the knights, and fighting must abide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The power that ministers to God's decrees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And executes on earth what heaven foresees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Called Providence, or Chance, or Fatal Sway,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Comes with resistless force, and finds, or makes, her way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor kings, nor nations, nor united power,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One moment can retard the appointed hour;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some one day, some wondrous chance appears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which happened not in centuries of years:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sure, whate'er we mortals hate, or love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or hope, or fear, depends on powers above;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They move our appetites to good or ill,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, by foresight, necessitate the will.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In Theseus this appears, whose youthful joy</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was beasts of chace in forests to destroy;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This gentle knight, inspired by jolly May,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Forsook his easy couch at early day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And to the wood and wilds pursued his way.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Beside him rode Hippolita the queen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Emily, attired in lively green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With horns, and hounds, and all the tuneful cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To hunt a royal hart, within the covert nigh:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as he followed Mars before, so now</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He serves the goddess of the silver bow.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The way, that Theseus took, was to the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where the two knights in cruel battle stood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The lawn, in which they fought, the appointed place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In which the uncoupled hounds began the chace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thither, forth-right, he rode to rouze the prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, shaded by the fern, in harbour lay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, thence dislodged, was wont to leave the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For open fields, and cross the crystal flood.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Approached, and looking underneath the sun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He saw proud Arcite, and fierce Palamon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In mortal battle doubling blow on blow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like lightning flamed their faulchions to and fro,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And shot a dreadful gleam; so strong they struck.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There seemed less force required to fell an oak.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He gazed with wonder on their equal might,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Looked eager on, but knew not either knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Resolved to learn, he spurred his fiery steed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With goring rowels to provoke his speed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The minute ended that began the race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So soon he was betwixt them on the place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, with his sword unsheathed, on pain of life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Commands both combatants to cease their strife:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, with imperious tone pursues his threat:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What are you? Why in arms together met?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How dares your pride presume against my laws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As in a listed field to fight your cause,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unasked the royal grant; no marshal by,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As knightly rites require; nor judge to try?&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then Palamon, with scarce recovered breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus hasty spoke:&mdash;We both deserve the death,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And both would die; for, look the world around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A pair so wretched is not to be found.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Our life's a load; encumbered with the charge,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We long to set the imprisoned soul at large.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now, as thou art a sovereign judge, decree</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rightful doom of death to him and me;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let neither find thy grace, for grace is cruelty.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Me first, O kill me first, and cure my woe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then sheath the sword of justice on my foe:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or kill him first; for when his name is heard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He foremost will receive his due reward.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite of Thebes is he, thy mortal foe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On whom thy grace did liberty bestow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But first contracted, that, if ever found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By day or night, upon the Athenian ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His head should pay the forfeit; see returned</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The perjured knight, his oath and honour scorned:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this is he, who, with a borrowed name</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And proffer'd service, to thy palace came,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now called Philostratus; retained by thee,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A traitor trusted, and in high degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Aspiring to the bed of beauteous Emily.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My part remains;&mdash;from Thebes my birth I own,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And call myself the unhappy Palamon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Think me not like that man, since no disgrace</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Can force me to renounce the honour of my race.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Know me for what I am: I broke thy chain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The love of liberty with life is given,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And life itself the inferior gift of heaven.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus without crime I fled; but farther know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I, with this Arcite, am thy mortal foe:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, give me death, since I thy life pursue;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For safeguard of thyself, death is my due.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More wouldst thou know, I love bright Emily,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And for her sake, and in her sight, will die:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But kill my rival too; for he no less</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Deserves, and I thy righteous doom will bless,</span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">To this replied the stern Athenian prince,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sourly smiled:&mdash;In owning your offence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You judge yourself, and I but keep record</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In place of law, while you pronounce the word.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take your desert, the death you have decreed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I seal your doom, and ratify the deed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Mars, the patron of my arms, you die.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He said; dumb sorrow seized the standers by.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The queen, above the rest, by nature good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(The pattern formed of perfect womanhood,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For tender pity wept: when she began,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through the bright choir the infectious virtue ran.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All dropped their tears, even the contended maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thus, among themselves, they softly said:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two youths of royal blood, renowned in fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mastership of heaven in face and mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And lovers, far beyond their faithless kind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">See their wide-streaming wounds; they neither came</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For pride of empire, nor desire of fame:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Kings fight for kingdoms, madmen for applause;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But love for love alone, that crowns the lover's cause.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This thought, which ever bribes the beauteous kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such pity wrought in every lady's mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They left their steeds, and, prostrate on the place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From the fierce king implored the offenders' grace.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He paused a while, stood silent in his mood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For yet his rage was boiling in his blood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But soon his tender mind the impression felt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As softest metals are not slow to melt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And pity soonest runs in gentle minds:<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then reasons with himself; and first he finds</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">His passion cast a mist before his sense,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And either made, or magnified, the offence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Offence! of what? to whom? who judged the cause?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The prisoner freed himself by Nature's laws:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Born free, he sought his right; the man he freed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was perjured, but his love excused the deed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus pondering, he looked under with his eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And saw the women's tears, and heard their cries;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which moved compassion more: he shook his head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And softly, sighing, to himself he said:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Curse on the unpardoning prince, whom tears can draw</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To no remorse; who rules by lions' law;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, deaf to prayers, by no submission bowed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rends all alike, the penitent and proud!&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At this, with look serene, he raised his head;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reason resumed her place, and passion fled.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then thus aloud he spoke:&mdash;The power of Love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In earth, and seas, and air, and heaven above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rules, unresisted, with an awful nod;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By daily miracles declared a god:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He blinds the wise, gives eye-sight to the blind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And moulds and stamps anew the lover's mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Behold that Arcite, and this Palamon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Freed from my fetters, and in safety gone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What hindered either, in their native soil,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At ease to reap the harvest of their toil?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Love, their lord, did otherwise ordain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And brought them in their own despite again,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To suffer death deserved; for well they know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis in my power, and I their deadly foe.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The proverb holds,&mdash;that to be wise, and love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is hardly granted to the gods above.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">See how the madmen bleed! behold the gains</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With which their master, Love, rewards their pains!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For seven long years, on duty every day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lo their obedience, and their monarch's pay:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Yet, as in duty bound, they serve him on;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, ask the fools, they think it wisely done;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor ease, nor wealth, nor life itself, regard;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For 'tis their maxim,&mdash;Love is love's reward.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This is not all,&mdash;the fair, for whom they strove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor knew before, nor could suspect their love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor thought, when she beheld the fight from far,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her beauty was the occasion of the war.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sure a general doom on man is past,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all are fools and lovers, first or last:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This, both by others and myself, I know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For I have served their sovereign long ago;</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of female snares, and felt the lover's pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And learned how far the god can human hearts constrain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To this remembrance, and the prayers of those,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">I give their forfeit lives, on this accord,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To do me homage, as their sovereign lord;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as my vassals, to their utmost might,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Assist my person, and assert my right.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This freely sworn, the knights their grace obtained;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then thus the king his secret thoughts explained:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If wealth, or honour, or a royal race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or each, or all, may win a lady's grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then either of you, knights, may well deserve</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A princess born; and such is she you serve:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For Emily is sister to the crown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And but too well to both her beauty known.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But should you combat till you both were dead,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two lovers cannot share a single bed.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Now hear the award, and happy may it prove</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The whole assembled troop was pleased as well,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Extol the award, and on their knees they fell</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Each to provide his champions for the day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">It might be deemed, on our historian's part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or too much negligence, or want of art,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If he forgot the vast magnificence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of royal Theseus, and his large expence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He first inclosed for lists a level ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The whole circumference a mile around;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The form was circular; and all without</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A trench was sunk, to moat the place about.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Within an amphitheatre appeared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Raised in degrees; to sixty paces reared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That when a man was placed in one degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Height was allowed for him above to see.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Eastward was built a gate of marble white;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The like adorned the western opposite.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A nobler object than this fabric was,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rome never saw, nor of so vast a space:</span><br />

  <span class="i0">All arts and artists Theseus could command:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who sold for hire, or wrought for better fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The master-painters, and the carvers, came.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So rose within the compass of the year</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An age's work, a glorious theatre.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A temple, sacred to the queen of love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An altar stood below; on either hand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A priest with roses crowned, who held a myrtle wand.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed,</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Loud menaces were heard, and foul disgrace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And bawling infamy, in language base;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Till sense was lost in sound, and silence fled the place.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The slayer of himself yet saw I there,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The gore congealed was clotted in his hair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With eyes half-closed, and gaping mouth he lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And grim, as when he breathed his sullen soul away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In midst of all the dome, Misfortune sat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Madness laughing in his ireful mood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And armed complaint on theft; and cries of blood.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There was the murdered corpse in covert laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And violent death in thousand shapes displayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The city to the soldier's rage resigned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Successless wars, and poverty behind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ships burnt in fight, or forced on rocky shores,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the rash hunter strangled by the boars;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The new-born babe by nurses overlaid;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the cook caught within the raging fire he made.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All ills of Mars his nature, flame, and steel;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The gasping charioteer, beneath the wheel</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of his own car; the ruined house, that falls</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The whole division that to Mars pertains,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All trades of death that deal in steel for gains,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were there; the butcher, armourer, and smith,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who forges sharpened faulchions, or the scythe.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With shouts, and soldiers' acclamations graced:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">A pointed sword hung threat'ning o'er his head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sustained but by a slender twine of thread.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There saw I Mars his ides, the Capitol,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The seer in vain foretelling Cæsar's fall;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The last triumvirs, and the wars they move,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Antony, who lost the world for love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These, and a thousand more, the fane adorn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their fates were painted ere the men were born,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All copied from the heavens, and ruling force</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of the red star, in his revolving course.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The form of Mars high on a chariot stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All sheathed in arms, and gruffly looked the God;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two geomantic figures were displayed</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Above his head, a warrior and a maid,<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></span><br />

  <span class="i1">Tired with deformities of death, I haste</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To the third temple, of Diana chaste.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shades on the sides, and in the midst a lawn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The silver Cynthia, with her nymphs around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pursued the flying deer, the woods with horns resound:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Calisto there stood manifest of shame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, turned a bear, the northern star became:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her son was next, and, by peculiar grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In the cold circle held the second place:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The stag Acteon in the stream had spied</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The naked huntress, and for seeing died;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His hounds, unknowing of his change, pursue</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chace, and their mistaken master slew.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Peneian Daphne too was there, to see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Apollo's love before, and now his tree.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks expressed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And hunting of the Caledonian beast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Oenides' valour, and his envied prize;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fatal power of Atalanta's eyes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Diana's vengeance on the victor shown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The murdress mother, and consuming son;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The Volscian queen extended on the plain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The treason punished, and the traitor slain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rest were various huntings, well designed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And savage beasts destroyed, of every kind.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The graceful goddess was arrayed in green;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>About her feet were little beagles seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That watched, with upward eyes, the motions of their queen.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her legs were buskined, and the left before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In act to shoot, a silver bow she bore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And at her back a painted quiver wore.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She trod a wexing moon, that soon would wane,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, drinking borrowed light, be filled again;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With downcast eyes, as seeming to survey</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dark dominions, her alternate sway.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before her stood a woman in her throes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And called Lucina's aid, her burden to disclose.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All these the painter drew with such command,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That Nature snatched the pencil from his hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ashamed and angry that his art could feign,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And mend the tortures of a mother's pain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Theseus beheld the fanes of every God,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thought his mighty cost was well bestowed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So princes now their poets should regard;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But few can write, and fewer can reward.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The theatre thus raised, the lists enclosed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all with vast magnificence disposed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We leave the monarch pleased, and haste to bring</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knights to combat, and their arms to sing.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The important enterprize, and give the bride;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For now the rivals round the world had sought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And each his number, well-appointed, brought.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The nations, far and near, contend in choice,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And send the flower of war by public voice;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That after, or before, were never known</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such chiefs, as each an army seemed alone:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beside the champions, all of high degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who knighthood loved, and deeds of chivalry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thronged to the lists, and envied to behold</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The names of others, not their own, enrolled.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor seems it strange; for every noble knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who loves the fair, and is endued with might,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In such a quarrel would be proud to fight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There breathes not scarce a man on British ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(An isle for love, and arms, of old renowned,)</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">But would have sold his life to purchase fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To Palamon or Arcite sent his name;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And had the land selected of the best,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Half had come hence, and let the world provide the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A hundred knights with Palamon there came,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Approved in fight, and men of mighty name;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their arms were several, as their nations were,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But furnished all alike with sword and spear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some wore coat armour, imitating scale,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some wore a breastplate and a light juppon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their horses clothed with rich caparison;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some for defence would leathern bucklers use,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of folded hides, and others shields of Pruce.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And one a heavy mace to stun the foe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One for his legs and knees provided well,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With jambeux<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> armed, and double plates of steel;<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">This on his helmet wore a lady's glove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And that a sleeve embroidered by his love.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With Palamon, above the rest in place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lycurgus came, the surly king of Thrace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Black was his beard, and manly was his face:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The balls of his broad eyes rolled in his head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And glared betwixt a yellow and a red;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">He looked a lion with a gloomy stare,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And o'er his eye-brows hung his matted hair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Big-boned, and large of limbs, with sinews strong,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Broad-shouldered, and his arms were round and long:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Four milk-white bulls (the Thracian use of old)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were yoked to draw his car of burnished gold.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Upright he stood, and bore aloft his shield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Conspicuous from afar, and overlooked the field.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His hair hung long behind, and glossy raven-black.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His ample forehead bore a coronet</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With sparkling diamonds, and with rubies set;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ten brace, and more, of greyhounds, snowy fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And tall as stags, ran loose, and coursed around his chair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A match for pards in flight, in grappling for the bear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And collars of the same their necks surround.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus through the field Lycurgus took his way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To match this monarch, with strong Arcite came</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Emetrius king of Inde, a mighty name!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On a bay courser, goodly to behold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The trappings of his horse embossed with barbarous gold.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not Mars bestrode a steed with greater grace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Adorned with pearls, all orient, round, and great;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His saddle was of gold, with emeralds set;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His shoulders large a mantle did attire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With rubies thick, and sparkling as the fire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His amber-coloured locks in ringlets run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With graceful negligence, and shone against the sun.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His nose was aquiline, his eyes were blue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ruddy his lips, and fresh and fair his hue;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skin:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">His awful presence did the crowd surprise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Eyes that confessed him born for kingly sway,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So fierce, they flashed intolerable day.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His age in nature's youthful prime appeared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And just began to bloom his yellow beard.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whene'er he spoke, his voice was heard around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Loud as a trumpet, with a silver sound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A laurel wreathed his temples, fresh and green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And myrtle sprigs, the marks of love, were mixed between.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Upon his fist he bore, for his delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An eagle well reclaimed, and lily white.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His hundred knights attend him to the war,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All armed for battle, save their heads were bare.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Words and devices blazed on every shield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And pleasing was the terror of the field.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For kings, and dukes, and barons, you might see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like sparkling stars, though different in degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All for the increase of arms, and love of chivalry.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before the king tame leopards led the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And troops of lions innocently play.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So Bacchus through the conquered Indies rode,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And beasts in gambols frisked before the honest god.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">In this array, the war of either side</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through Athens passed with military pride.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At prime, they entered on the Sunday morn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rich tapestry spread the streets, and flowers the posts<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> adorn.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The town was all a jubilee of feasts;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So Theseus willed, in honour of his guests:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Himself with open arms the kings embraced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then all the rest in their degrees were graced.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No harbinger was needful for the night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For every house was proud to lodge a knight.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">I pass the royal treat, nor must relate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The gifts bestowed, nor how the champions sate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who first, who last, or how the knights addressed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their vows, or who was fairest at the feast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose voice, whose graceful dance did most surprise;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Soft amorous sighs, and silent love of eyes.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rivals call my muse another way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To sing their vigils for the ensuing day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">'Twas ebbing darkness, past the noon of night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Phosphor, on the confines of the light,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Promised the sun; ere day began to spring,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The tuneful lark already stretched her wing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And flickering on her nest, made short essays to sing,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When wakeful Palamon, preventing day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Took to the royal lists his early way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To Venus at her fane, in her own house, to pray.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There, falling on his knees before her shrine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He thus implored with prayers her power divine:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Creator Venus, genial power of love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bliss of men below, and Gods above!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dost fairest shine, and best become thy place.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy month reveals the spring, and opens all the year.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thee, Goddess, thee the storms of winter fly,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Earth smiles with flowers renewing, laughs the sky,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For thee the lion loaths the taste of blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And roaring hunts his female through the wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And tempt the stream, and snuff their absent loves.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Tis thine, whate'er is pleasant, good, or fair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All nature is thy province, life thy care;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thou mad'st the world, and dost the world repair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Increase of Jove, companion of the sun!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">If e'er Adonis touched thy tender heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Have pity, Goddess, for thou know'st the smart!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alas! I have not words to tell my grief;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To vent my sorrow would be some relief:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Light sufferings give us leisure to complain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We groan, but cannot speak, in greater pain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O Goddess, tell thyself what I would say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou know'st it, and I feel too much to pray.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So grant my suit, as I enforce my might</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In love to be thy champion, and thy knight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A servant to thy sex, a slave to thee,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A foe profest to barren chastity.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor ask I fame or honour of the field,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In my divine Emilia make me blest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Let fate, or partial chance, dispose the rest:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Find thou the manner, and the means prepare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Possession, more than conquest, is my care.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mars is the warrior's God; in him it lies</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On whom he favours to confer the prize;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With smiling aspect you serenely move</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In your fifth orb, and rule the realm of love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fates but only spin the coarser clue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The finest of the wool is left for you.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Spare me but one small portion of the twine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And let the sisters cut below your line:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rest among the rubbish may they sweep,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or add it to the yarn of some old miser's heap.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, if you this ambitious prayer deny,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A wish, I grant, beyond mortality,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite's arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And I, once dead, let him possess her charms!&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus ended he; then, with observance due,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sacred incense on her altar threw:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">At once the gracious Goddess gave the sign,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her statue shook, and trembled all the shrine:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, since the flames pursued the trailing smoke,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He knew his boon was granted; but the day</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To distance driven, and joy adjourned with long delay.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Now morn with rosy light had streaked the sky,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Addressed her early steps to Cynthia's fane,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In state attended by her maiden train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who bore the vests that holy rites require,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Incense, and odorous gums, and covered fire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the moon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now while the temple smoked with hallowed steam,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They wash the virgin in a living stream;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret ceremonies I conceal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Uncouth, perhaps unlawful, to reveal:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But such they were as pagan use required,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Performed by women when the men retired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Might turn to scandal, or obscene delights.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well-meaners think no harm; but for the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Things sacred they pervert, and silence is the best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her shining hair, uncombed, was loosely spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A crown of mastless oak adorned her head:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When to the shrine approached, the spotless maid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had kindling fires on either altar laid:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(The rites were such as were observed of old,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Statius in his Theban story told.)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then kneeling with her hands across her breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus lowly she preferred her chaste request:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">O Goddess, haunter of the woodland green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Queen of the nether skies, where half the year</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy silver beams descend, and light the gloomy sphere;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Goddess of maids, and conscious of our hearts,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Which Niobe's devoted issue felt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When hissing through the skies the feathered deaths were dealt,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As I desire to live a virgin life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor know the name of mother or of wife.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy votress from my tender years I am,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And love, like thee, the woods and sylvan game.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like death, thou know'st, I loath the nuptial state,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And man, the tyrant of our sex, I hate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A lowly servant, but a lofty mate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where love is duty, on the female side;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On their's mere sensual gust, and sought with surly pride.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now by thy triple shape, as thou art seen</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In heaven, earth, hell, and every where a queen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Grant this my first desire; let discord cease,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Quench their hot fire, or far from me remove</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The flame, and turn it on some other love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or if my frowning stars have so decreed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That one must be rejected, one succeed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Make him my lord, within whose faithful breast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is fixed my image, and who loves me best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, oh! even that avert! I chuse it not,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But take it as the least unhappy lot.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A maid I am, and of thy virgin train;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Oh, let me still that spotless name retain!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Frequent the forests, thy chaste will obey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And only make the beasts of chace my prey!&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The flames ascend on either altar clear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While thus the blameless maid addressed her prayer.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When lo! the burning fire, that shone so bright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Flew off all sudden, with extinguished light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And left one altar dark a little space,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which turned self-kindled, and renewed the blaze;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>

  <span class="i0">Then fell, and lifeless left the extinguished wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For ever lost, the irrevocable light</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forsook the black'ning coals, and sunk to night:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At either end it whistled as it flew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And as the brands were green, so dropped the dew;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The maid from that ill omen turned her eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor knew what signified the boding sign,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But found the powers displeased, and feared the wrath divine.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then shook the sacred shrine, and sudden light</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sprung through the vaulted roof, and made the temple bright.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The Power, behold! the Power in glory shone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By her bent bow and her keen arrows known;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rest, a huntress issuing from the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reclining on her cornel spear she stood.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then gracious thus began:&mdash;Dismiss thy fear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And heaven's unchanged decrees attentive hear:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More powerful gods have torn thee from my side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unwilling to resign, and doomed a bride:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The two contending knights are weighed above;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One Mars protects, and one the Queen of love:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But which the man, is in the Thunderer's breast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This he pronounced, 'tis he who loves thee best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fire, that, once extinct, revived again,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Foreshews the love allotted to remain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Farewell!&mdash;she said, and vanished from the place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sheaf of arrows shook, and rattled in the case.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Aghast at this, the royal virgin stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Disclaimed, and now no more a sister of the wood:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But to the parting Goddess thus she prayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Propitious still, be present to my aid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor quite abandon your once-favoured maid.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Then sighing she returned; but smiled betwixt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With hopes, and fears, and joys with sorrows mixt.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The next returning planetary hour</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of Mars, who shared the heptarchy of power,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To adore with pagan rites the power armipotent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then prostrate low before his altar lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And raised his manly voice, and thus began to pray:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Strong God of Arms, whose iron sceptre sways</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The freezing North, and Hyperborean seas,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Scythian colds, and Thracia's wintry coast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where stand thy steeds, and thou art honoured most:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There most; but every where thy power is known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fortune of the fight is all thy own:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Terror is thine, and wild amazement, flung</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From out thy chariot, withers even the strong;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And disarray and shameful rout ensue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And force is added to the fainting crew&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer!</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If to my utmost power with sword and shield</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I dared the death, unknowing how to yield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And falling in my rank, still kept the field,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then let my arms prevail, by thee sustained,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Have pity on my pains; nor those unknown</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Venus, the public care of all above,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Now, by her blandishments and powerful charms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When yielded she lay curling in thy arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even by thy shame, if shame it may be called,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When Vulcan had thee in his net enthralled;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(O envied ignominy, sweet disgrace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When every God that saw thee wished thy place!)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By those dear pleasures, aid my arms in fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And make me conquer in my patron's right:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">For I am young, a novice in the trade,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fool of love, unpractised to persuade:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And want the soothing arts that catch the fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, caught myself, lie struggling in the snare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And she I love, or laughs at all my pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or knows her worth too well, and pays me with disdain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sure I am, unless I win in arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To stand excluded from Emilia's charms:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor can my strength avail, unless, by thee</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Endued with force, I gain the victory;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then for the fire which warmed thy generous heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pity thy subject's pains, and equal smart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So be the morrow's sweat and labour mine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The palm and honour of the conquest thine:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then shall the war, and stern debate, and strife</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Immortal, be the business of my life;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in thy fane, the dusty spoils among,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">High on the burnished roof, my banner shall be hung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ranked with my champions' bucklers; and below,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With arms reversed, the achievements of my foe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While day to night, and night to day succeeds,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of incense, and the grateful steam of blood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And fires eternal in thy temple shine.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This bush of yellow beard, this length of hair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which from my birth inviolate I bear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Guiltless of steel, and from the razor free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shall fall a plenteous crop, reserved for thee.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So may my arms with victory be blest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I ask no more, let fate dispose the rest.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The champion ceased: there followed in the close</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A hollow groan; a murmuring wind arose;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rings of iron, that on the doors were hung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sent out a jarring sound, and harshly rung:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Sent out a jarring sound, and harshly rung:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bolted gates flew open at the blast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The storm rushed in, and Arcite stood aghast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The flames were blown aside, yet shone they bright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fanned by the wind, and gave a ruffled light.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then from the ground a scent began to rise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sweet smelling as accepted sacrifice:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This omen pleased, and, as the flames aspire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor wanted hymns to Mars, or heathen charms:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length the nodding statue clashed his arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with a sullen sound and feeble cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Half-sunk, and half-pronounced the word of victory.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this, with soul devout, he thanked the God,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, of success secure, returned to his abode.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">These vows, thus granted, raised a strife above</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She, granting first, had right of time to plead;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But he had granted too, nor would recede.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Jove was for Venus, but he feared his wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And seemed unwilling to decide the strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And found a way the difference to compose:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though sparing of his grace, to mischief bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He seldom does a good with good intent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wayward, but wise; by long experience taught,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To please both parties, for ill ends, he sought:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this advantage age from youth has won,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As not to be outridden, though outrun.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By fortune he was now to Venus trined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with stern Mars in Capricorn was joined:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of him disposing in his own abode,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He soothed the Goddess, while he gulled the God:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cease, daughter, to complain, and stint the strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Mars, the lord of conquest, in the fight</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Each asking a gigantic force to rear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All spoke as partial favour moved the mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, safe themselves, at others' cost divined.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Waked by the cries, the Athenian chief arose,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knightly forms of combat to dispose;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And passing through the obsequious guards, he sate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Conspicuous on a throne, sublime in state;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There, for the two contending knights he sent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Armed cap-a-pee, with reverence low they bent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He smiled on both, and with superior look</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alike their offered adoration took.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The people press on every side to see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their awful prince, and hear his high decree.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then signing to the heralds with his hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They gave his orders from their lofty stand.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Silence is thrice enjoined; then thus aloud</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The king at arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Our sovereign lord has pondered in his mind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The means to spare the blood of gentle kind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And of his grace, and inborn clemency,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He modifies his first severe decree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The keener edge of battle to rebate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The troops for honour fighting, not for hate.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He wills, not death should terminate their strife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wounds, if wounds ensue, be short of life;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But issues, ere the fight, his dread command,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That slings afar, and poniards hand to hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Be banished from the field; that none shall dare</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With shortened sword to stab in closer war;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in fair combat fight with manly strength,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor push with biting point, but strike at length.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tourney is allowed but one career,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of the tough ash, with the sharp-grinded spear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And fight on foot their honour to regain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor, if at mischief<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> taken, on the ground</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Be slain, but prisoners to the pillar bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At either barrier placed; nor (captives made,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Be freed, or armed anew the fight invade.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chief of either side, bereft of life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or yielded to his foe, concludes the strife.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus dooms the lord; now, valiant knights and young,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fight each his fill with swords and maces long.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">The herald ends: The vaulted firmament</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So just, and yet so provident of blood!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This was the general cry. The trumpets sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And warlike symphony is heard around.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The marching troops through Athens take their way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The great earl-marshal orders their array.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fair from high the passing pomp behold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A rain of flowers is from the windows rolled.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The casements are with golden tissue spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And horses hoofs, for earth, on silken tapestry tread.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The king goes midmost, and the rivals ride</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In equal rank, and close his either side.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Next after these, there rode the royal wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With Emily, the cause, and the reward of strife.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The following cavalcade, by three and three,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proceed by titles marshalled in degree.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus through the southern gate they take their way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And at the lists arrived ere prime of day.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There, parting from the king, the chiefs divide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wheeling east and west, before their many ride.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And after him the queen and Emily:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Next these, the kindred of the crown are graced</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With nearer seats, and lords by ladies placed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Scarce were they seated, when with clamours loud</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In rushed at once a rude promiscuous crowd:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The guards, and then each other overbear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in a moment throng the spacious theatre.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As winds forsaking seas more softly blow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When at the western gate, on which the car</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is placed aloft, that bears the God of war,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proud Arcite, entering armed before his train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stops at the barrier, and divides the plain.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Red was his banner, and displayed abroad</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bloody colours of his patron God.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At that self moment enters Palamon</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The gate of Venus, and the rising Sun;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Waved by the wanton winds, his banner flies,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All maiden white, and shares the people's eyes.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From east to west, look all the world around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two troops so matched were never to be found;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such bodies built for strength, of equal age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In stature sized; so proud an equipage:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The nicest eye could no distinction make,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where lay the advantage, or what side to take.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus ranged, the herald for the last proclaims</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A silence, while they answered to their names:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For so the king decreed, to shun with<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> care</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fraud of musters false, the common bane of war.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tale was just, and then the gates were closed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And chief to chief, and troop to troop opposed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The heralds last retired, and loudly cried,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fortune of the field be fairly tried!</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this, the challenger, with fierce defy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His trumpets sounds; the challenged makes reply.</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their vizors closed, their lances in the rest,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And spurring see decrease the middle space.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A cloud of smoke envelopes either host,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all at once the combatants are lost:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Coursers with coursers jostling, men with men:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As labouring in eclipse, a while they stay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till the next blast of wind restores the day.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">They look anew; the beauteous form of fight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is changed, and war appears a grizzly sight.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two troops in fair array one moment shewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The next, a field with fallen bodies strewed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not half the number in their seats are found;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The points of spears are stuck within the shield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The steeds without their riders scour the field.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knights, unhorsed, on foot renew the fight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The glittering faulchions cast a gleaming light;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hauberks and helms are hewed with many a wound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Out spins the streaming blood, and dyes the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mighty maces with such haste descend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They break the bones, and make the solid armour bend.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This thrusts amid the throng with furious force;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Down goes, at once, the horseman and the horse:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That courser stumbles on the fallen steed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And floundring throws the rider o'er his head.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One rolls along, a foot-ball to his foes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One with a broken truncheon deals his blows.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This halting, this disabled with his wound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In triumph led, is to the pillar bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where by the king's award he must abide;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There goes a captive led on t'other side.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By fits they cease; and leaning on the lance,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take breath a while, and to new fight advance.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Full oft the rivals met, and neither spared</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His utmost force, and each forgot to ward.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The head of this was to the saddle bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> other backward to the crupper sent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both were by turns unhorsed; the jealous blows</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fall thick and heavy, when on foot they close.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So deep their faulchions bite, that every stroke</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pierced to the quick, and equal wounds they gave and took.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Borne far asunder by the tides of men,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like adamant and steel they meet again.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So when a tyger sucks the bullock's blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A famished lion issuing from the wood</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Roars lordly fierce, and challenges the food.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each claims possession, neither will obey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But both their paws are fastened on the prey;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The swains come armed between, and both to distance drive.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At length, as fate foredoomed, and all things tend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By course of time to their appointed end;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So when the sun to west was far declined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And both afresh in mortal battle joined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The strong Emetrius came in Arcite's aid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Palamon with odds was overlaid:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For turning short, he<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> struck with all his might</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Full on the helmet of the unwary knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deep was the wound; he staggered with the blow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And turned him to his unexpected foe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom with such force he struck, he felled him down,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cleft the circle of his golden crown.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Arcite's men, who now prevailed in fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Twice ten at once surround the single knight:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">O'erpowered, at length, they force him to the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unyielded as he was, and to the pillar bound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And king Lycurgus, while he fought in vain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His friend to free, was tumbled on the plain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Who now laments but Palamon, compelled</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No more to try the fortune of the field!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, worse than death, to view with hateful eyes</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His rival's conquest, and renounce the prize!</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The royal judge on his tribunal placed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who had beheld the fight from first to last,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bade cease the war; pronouncing from on high</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sound of trumpets to the voice replied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And round the royal lists the heralds cried,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous bride!</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The people rend the skies with vast applause;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All own the chief, when fortune owns the cause.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arcite is owned even by the Gods above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So laughed he, when the rightful Titan failed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Jove's usurping arms in heaven prevailed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Laughed all the powers who favour tyranny,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all the standing army of the sky.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Venus with dejected eyes appears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, weeping, on the lists distilled her tears;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her will refused, which grieves a woman most,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, in her champion foiled, the cause of Love is lost.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till Saturn said:&mdash;Fair daughter, now be still:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The blustering fool has satisfied his will;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His boon is given; his knight has gained the day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But lost the prize; the arrears are yet to pay.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy hour is come, and mine the care shall be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To please thy knight, and set thy promise free.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Now while the heralds run the lists around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Arcite, Arcite, heaven and earth resound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A miracle (nor less could it be called)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their joy with unexpected sorrow palled.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The victor knight had laid his helm aside,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Part for his ease, the greater part for pride,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bare-headed, popularly low he bowed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And paid the salutations of the crowd;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, spurring, at full speed, ran endlong on</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where Theseus sat on his imperial throne;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Furious he drove, and upward cast his eye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where next the queen was placed his Emily;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then passing, to the saddle-bow he bent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(For women, to the brave an easy prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still follow Fortune where she leads the way;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Just then from earth sprung out a flashing fire,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Pluto sent, at Saturn's bad desire:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The startling steed was seized with sudden fright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, bounding, o'er the pommel cast the knight:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forward he flew, and, pitching on his head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He quivered with his feet, and lay for dead.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Black was his countenance in a little space,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For all the blood was gathered in his face.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Help was at hand: they reared him from the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from his cumberous arms his limbs unbound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then lanced a vein, and watched returning breath;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It came, but clogged with symptoms of his death.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The saddle-bow the noble parts had prest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All bruised and mortified his manly breast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Him still entranced, and in a litter laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They bore from field, and to his bed conveyed.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">At length he waked, and with a feeble cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The word he first pronounced was Emily.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Meantime the king, though inwardly he mourned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In pomp triumphant to the town returned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Attended by the chiefs, who fought the field;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Now friendly mixed, and in one troop compelled.)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And bade them not for Arcite's life to fear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But that which gladded all the warrior train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though most were sorely wounded, none were slain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The surgeons soon despoiled them of their arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some with salves they cure, and some with charms;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Foment the bruises, and the pains assuage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The king, in person, visits all around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Comforts the sick, congratulates the sound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Honours the princely chiefs, rewards the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And holds, for thrice three days, a royal feast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">None were disgraced, for falling is no shame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cowardice alone is loss of fame.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But 'tis the fault of fortune, not his own:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If crowns and palms the conquering side adorn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The victor under better stars was born:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The brave man seeks not popular applause,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor, overpowered with arms, deserts his cause;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unshamed, though foiled, he does the best he can;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Force is of brutes, but honour is of man.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And each was set according to his place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With ease were reconciled the differing parts,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For envy never dwells in noble hearts.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length they took their leave, the time expired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well pleased, and to their several homes retired.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Well pleased, and to their several homes retired.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Meanwhile the health of Arcite still impairs;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From bad proceeds to worse, and mocks the leeches' cares:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Swollen is his breast, his inward pains increase,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All means are used, and all without success.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Corrupts, and there remains in spite of art;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor breathing veins, nor cupping, will prevail;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All outward remedies and inward fail:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mould of nature's fabric is destroyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her vessels discomposed, her virtue void:</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The bellows of his lungs begins to swell;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Nought profits him to save abandoned life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor vomits upward aid, nor downward laxative.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The midmost region battered and destroyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When nature cannot work, the effect of art is void;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For physic can but mend our crazy state,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">"No language can express the smallest part</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of what I feel, and suffer in my heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For you, whom best I love and value most:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But to your service I bequeath my ghost;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which, from this mortal body when untied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unseen, unheard, shall hover at your side;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Nor fright you waking, nor your sleep offend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But wait officious, and your steps attend.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How I have loved, excuse my faultering tongue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My spirits feeble, and my pains are strong:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This I may say, I only grieve to die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because I lose my charming Emily.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To die, when heaven had put you in my power!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fate could not chuse a more malicious hour.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What greater curse could envious fortune give,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than just to die, when I began to live!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Vain men! how vanishing a bliss we crave,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now warm in love, now withering in the grave!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Never, O never more to see the sun!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still dark, in a damp vault, and still alone!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This fate is common; but I lose my breath</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Near bliss, and yet not blessed, before my death.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Farewell! but take me, dying, in your arms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis all I can enjoy of all your charms:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This hand I cannot but in death resign;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ah, could I live! but while I live 'tis mine.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I feel my end approach, and, thus embraced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Am pleased to die; but hear me speak my last:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ah, my sweet foe! for you, and you alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I broke my faith with injured Palamon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But love the sense of right and wrong confounds;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And much, I doubt, should heaven my life prolong,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I should return to justify my wrong;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, while my former flames remain within,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Repentance is but want of power to sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With mortal hatred I pursued his life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor he, nor you, were guilty of the strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor I, but as I loved; yet all combined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your beauty, and my impotence of mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And his concurrent flame, that blew my fire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For still our kindred souls had one desire.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">He had a moment's right, in point of time;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had I seen first, then his had been the crime.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fate made it mine, and justified his right;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For virtue, valour, and for noble blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Truth, honour, all that is comprised in good;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So help me heaven, in all the world is none</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So worthy to be loved as Palamon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He loves you too, with such a holy fire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As will not, cannot, but with life expire:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Our vowed affections both have often tried,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor any love but yours could ours divide.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, by my love's inviolable band,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By my long-suffering, and my short command,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Have pity on the faithful Palamon.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This was his last; for death came on amain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And exercised below his iron reign;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then upward to the seat of life he goes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sense fled before him, what he touched he froze:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though less and less of Emily he saw;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So, speechless, for a little space he lay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then grasped the hand he held, and sighed his soul away.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But whither went his soul, let such relate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who search the secrets of the future state:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Divines can say but what themselves believe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Strong proofs they have, but not demonstrative;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And faith itself be lost in certainty.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To live uprightly, then, is sure the best;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To save ourselves, and not to damn the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The soul of Arcite went where heathens go,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who better live than we, though less they know.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">In Palamon a manly grief appears;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">That grove, for ever green, that conscious lawnd,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></span><br />

  <span class="i0">There other flames might waste his earthly part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And burn his limbs, where love had burned his heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This once resolved, the peasants were enjoined,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">With sounding axes to the grove they go,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">On which the lifeless body should be reared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Covered with cloth of gold; on which was laid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The corpse of Arcite, in like robes arrayed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">White gloves were on his hands, and on his head</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A wreath of laurel, mixed with myrtle, spread.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sword, keen-edged, within his right he held,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The warlike emblem of the conquered field.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The third his bow; and, glorious to behold,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And through the master-street the corpse conveyed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The houses to their tops with black were spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And even the pavements were with mourning hid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The right side of the pall old Egeus kept,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And on the left the royal Theseus wept;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each bore a golden bowl, of work divine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With honey filled, and milk, and mixed with ruddy wine.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then Palamon, the kinsman of the slain;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">To grace the pomp, came Emily the bright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With covered fire, the funeral pile to light.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With high devotion was the service made,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Nor how the birds to foreign seats repaired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or beasts that bolted out, and saw the forest bared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor how the ground, now cleared, with ghastly fright,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">The straw, as first I said, was laid below;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Still, as they turned, they beat their clattering shields;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The women mix their cries, and clamour fills the fields.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The warlike wakes continued all the night,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">I pass the rest. The year was fully mourned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Palamon long since to Thebes returned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When, by the Grecians' general consent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At Athens Theseus held his parliament;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Among the laws that passed, it was decreed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That conquered Thebes from bondage should be freed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reserving homage to the Athenian throne,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To which the sovereign summoned Palamon.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unknowing of the cause, he took his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mournful in mind, and still in black array.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The monarch mounts the throne, and, placed on high,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Commands into the court the beauteous Emily.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So called, she came; the senate rose, and paid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Becoming reverence to the royal maid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And first soft whispers through the assembly went;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With silent wonder then they watched the event:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All hushed, the king arose with awful grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deep thought was in his breast, and counsel in his face:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">At length he sighed, and, having first prepared</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The attentive audience, thus his will declared:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The Cause and Spring of motion, from above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hung down on earth, the golden chain of Love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Great was the effect, and high was his intent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When peace among the jarring seeds he sent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fire, flood, and earth, and air, by this were bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And love, the common link, the new creation crowned.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chain still holds; for, though the forms decay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Eternal matter never wears away:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The same first mover certain bounds has placed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How long those perishable forms shall last;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor can they last beyond the time assigned</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By that all-seeing, and all-making Mind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shorten their hours they may; for will is free;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But never pass the appointed destiny.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So men oppressed, when weary of their breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Throw off the burden, and suborn their death.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, since those forms begin, and have their end,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On some unaltered cause they sure depend:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Parts of the whole are we; but God the whole;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who gives us life, and animating soul.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For nature cannot from a part derive</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That being, which the whole can only give:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He, perfect, stable; but imperfect we,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Subject to change, and different in degree;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Plants, beasts, and man; and, as our organs are,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We, more or less, of his perfection share.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, by a long descent, the ethereal fire</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Corrupts; and forms, the mortal part, expire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As he withdraws his virtue, so they pass,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the same matter makes another mass.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That every kind should by succession live;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That individuals die, his will ordains;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The propagated species still remains.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Three centuries he grows, and three he stays,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Supreme in state, and in three more decays:</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And towns and towers their fatal periods meet:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So rivers, rapid once, now naked lie,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forsaken of their springs, and leave their channels dry:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So man, at first a drop, dilates with heat,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Secret he feeds, unknowing in the cell;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length, for hatching ripe, he breaks the shell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And struggles into breath, and cries for aid;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, helpless, in his mother's lap is laid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He creeps, he walks, and, issuing into man,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Grudges their life, from whence his own began;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Retchless of laws, affects to rule alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Anxious to reign, and restless on the throne;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">First vegetive, then feels, and reasons last;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rich of three souls, and lives all three to waste.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some thus, but thousands more in flower of age;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For few arrive to run the latter stage.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sunk in the first, in battle some are slain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And others whelmed beneath the stormy main.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What makes all this, but Jupiter the king,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At whose command we perish, and we spring?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then 'tis our best, since thus ordained to die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To make a virtue of necessity;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take what he gives, since to rebel is vain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bad grows better, which we well sustain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And could we chuse the time, and chuse aright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis best to die, our honour at the height.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When we have done our ancestors no shame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But served our friends, and well secured our fame;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then should we wish our happy life to close,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And leave no more for fortune to dispose.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">So should we make our death a glad relief</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From future shame, from sickness, and from grief;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enjoying, while we live, the present hour,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And dying in our excellence and flower.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then round our death-bed every friend should run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And joyous of our conquest early won;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While the malicious world, with envious tears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Should grudge our happy end, and wish it theirs.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since then our Arcite is with honour dead,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why should we mourn, that he so soon is freed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or call untimely, what the gods decreed?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With grief as just, a friend may be deplored,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From a foul prison to free air restored.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Could tears recal him into wretched life?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their sorrow hurts themselves; on him is lost;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, worse than both, offends his happy ghost.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What then remains, but, after past annoy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To take the good vicissitude of joy;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To thank the gracious gods for what they give,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Possess our souls, and while we live, to live?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ordain we then two sorrows to combine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in one point the extremes of grief to join;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That thence resulting joy may be renewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As jarring notes in harmony conclude.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then I propose, that Palamon shall be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In marriage joined with beauteous Emily;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For which already I have gained the assent</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of my free people in full parliament.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long love to her has borne the faithful knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And well deserved, had fortune done him right:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis time to mend her fault, since Emily,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Arcite's death, from former vows is free;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If you, fair sister, ratify the accord,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And take him for your husband and your lord.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis no dishonour to confer your grace</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On one descended from a royal race;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And were he less, yet years of service past,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From grateful souls, exact reward at last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pity is heaven's and your's; nor can she find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A throne so soft as in a woman's mind.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He said: she blushed; and, as o'erawed by might,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seemed to give Theseus what she gave the knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then, turning to the Theban, thus he said:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Small arguments are needful to persuade</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your temper to comply with my command:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, speaking thus, he gave Emilia's hand.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Smiled Venus, to behold her own true knight</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Obtain the conquest, though he lost the fight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And blessed, with nuptial bliss, the sweet laborious night.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Eros and Anteros, on either side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One fired the bridegroom, and one warmed the bride;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And long-attending Hymen, from above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Showered on the bed the whole Idalian grove.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All of a tenor was their after-life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No day discoloured with domestic strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No jealousy, but mutual truth believed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Secure repose, and kindness undeceived.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus heaven, beyond the compass of his thought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sent him the blessing he so dearly bought.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">So may the Queen of Love long duty bless,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all true lovers find the same success!</span><br />

<blockquote><p>The accurate Tyrwhitt detected the original of this fable in
the translation of "Æsop," made by Marie of France into Norman-French
for the amusement of the court of England, by which
that language was used down to the reign of Edward. But the
hand of genius gilds what it touches; and the naked Apologue,
which may be found in Tyrwhitt's "Preliminary Discourse," was
amplified by Chaucer into a poem, which, in grave, ironical narrative,
liveliness of illustration, and happiness of humorous description,
yields to none that ever was written. Dryden, whom "The
Hind and Panther" had familiarized with this species of composition,
has executed a version at once literal and spirited, which
seldom omits what is valuable in his original, and often adds those
sparks which genius strikes out, when in collision with the work of
a kindred spirit.</p></blockquote>

 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">T</span> <span class="smcap">here</span> lived, as authors tell, in days of yore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A widow, somewhat old, and very poor;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well thatched, and under covert of a wood.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This dowager, on whom my tale I found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since last she laid her husband in the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A simple sober life in patience led,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And had but just enough to buy her bread;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But housewifing the little heaven had lent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She duly paid a groat for quarter rent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And pinched her belly, with her daughters two,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To bring the year about with much ado.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The cattle in her homestead were three sows,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An ewe called Mally, and three brinded cows.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of savoury smell, and rushes strewed the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A maple dresser in her hall she had,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On which full many a slender meal she made:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">For no delicious morsel passed her throat;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">According to her cloth she cut her coat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No poignant sauce she knew, no costly treat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her hunger gave a relish to her meat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sparing diet did her health assure;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or sick, a pepper posset was her cure.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before the day was done, her work she sped,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And never went by candle-light to bed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With exercise she sweat ill humours out;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her dancing was not hindered by the gout.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her poverty was glad, her heart content,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of wine she never tasted through the year,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But white and black was all her homely cheer;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Brown bread and milk, (but first she skimmed her bowls,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And rashers of singed bacon on the coals;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On holidays an egg, or two at most;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But her ambition never reached to roast.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">A yard she had, with pales enclosed about,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some high, some low, and a dry ditch without.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Within this homestead lived, without a peer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For crowing loud, the noble Chanticleer;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So hight her cock, whose singing did surpass</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The merry notes of organs at the mass.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More certain was the crowing of the cock</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To number hours, than is an abbey-clock;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sooner than the mattin-bell was rung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He clapped his wings upon his roost, and sung:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For when degrees fifteen ascended right,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By sure instinct he knew 'twas one at night.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">High was his comb, and coral-red withal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In dents embattled like a castle wall;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His bill was raven-black, and shone like jet;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Blue were his legs, and orient were his feet;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">White were his nails, like silver to behold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His body glittering like the burnished gold.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">This gentle cock, for solace of his life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Six misses had, beside his lawful wife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Scandal, that spares no king, though ne'er so good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Says, they were all of his own flesh and blood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His sisters, both by sire and mother's side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sure their likeness shewed them near allied.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But make the worst, the monarch did no more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than all the Ptolemys had done before:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When incest is for interest of a nation,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis made no sin by holy dispensation.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some lines have been maintained by this alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which by their common ugliness are known.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But passing this as from our tale apart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dame Partlet<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> was the sovereign of his heart:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ardent in love, outrageous in his play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He feathered her a hundred times a day;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And she, that was not only passing fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But was withal discreet, and debonair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though loth, and let him work his wicked will:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At board and bed was affable and kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>According as their marriage-vow did bind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And as the church's precept had enjoined.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even since she was a se'nnight old, they say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Was chaste and humble to her dying day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor chick nor hen was known to disobey.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">By this her husband's heart she did obtain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What cannot beauty, joined with virtue, gain!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She was his only joy, and he her pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She, when he walked, went pecking by his side;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">If, spurning up the ground, he sprung a corn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tribute in his bill to her was borne.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But oh! what joy it was to hear him sing</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In summer, when the day began to spring,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stretching his neck, and warbling in his throat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><em>Solus cum sola</em>, then was all his note.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For in the days of yore, the birds of parts</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were bred to speak, and sing, and learn the liberal arts.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">It happ'd that perching on the parlour-beam,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Amidst his wives, he had a deadly dream,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Just at the dawn; and sighed, and groaned so fast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As every breath he drew would be his last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dame Partlet, ever nearest to his side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Heard all his piteous moan, and how he cried</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For help from Gods and men; and sore aghast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She pecked and pulled, and wakened him at last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dear heart, said she, for love of heaven declare</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your pain, and make me partner of your care.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You groan, Sir, ever since the morning-light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As something had disturbed your noble sprite.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And, madam, well I might, said Chanticleer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Never was shrovetide-cock in such a fear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even still I run all over in a sweat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My princely senses not recovered yet.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For such a dream I had of dire portent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That much I fear my body will be shent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It bodes I shall have wars and woeful strife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or in a loathsome dungeon end my life.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Know, dame, I dreamt within my troubled breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That in our yard I saw a murderous beast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That on my body would have made arrest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With waking eyes I ne'er beheld his fellow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His colour was betwixt a red and yellow:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tipped was his tail, and both his pricking ears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With black, and much unlike his other hairs:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The rest, in shape a beagle's whelp throughout,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With broader forehead, and a sharper snout:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That yet, methinks, I see him with surprise.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reach out your hand, I drop with clammy sweat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And lay it to my heart, and feel it beat.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now fie for shame! quoth she; by heaven above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou hast for ever lost thy lady's love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No woman can endure a recreant knight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He must be bold by day, and free by night:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Our sex desires a husband or a friend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who can our honour and his own defend;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wise, hardy, secret, liberal of his purse;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A fool is nauseous, but a coward worse:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No bragging coxcomb, yet no baffled knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How dar'st thou talk of love, and dar'st not fight?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How dar'st thou tell thy dame thou art affeared?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hast thou no manly heart, and hast a beard?</span><br />
  <span class="i1">If aught from fearful dreams may be divined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They signify a cock of dunghill kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All dreams, as in old Galen I have read,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Are from repletion and complexion bred;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From rising fumes of indigested food,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And noxious humours that infect the blood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sure, my lord, if I can read aright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These foolish fancies, you have had to-night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Are certain symptoms (in the canting style)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of boiling choler, and abounding bile;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Engenders all these visionary thoughts.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When choler overflows, then dreams are bred</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of flames, and all the family of red;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For humours are distinguished by their hue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From hence we dream of wars and warlike things,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wasps and hornets with their double wings.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Choler adust congeals our blood with fear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In sanguine airy dreams aloft we bound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With rheums oppressed, we sink in rivers drowned.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">More I could say, but thus conclude my theme,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dominating humour makes the dream.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cato was in his time accounted wise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And he condemns them all for empty lies.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take my advice, and when we fly to ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With laxatives preserve your body sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And purge the peccant humours that abound.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I should be loth to lay you on a bier;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And though there lives no 'pothecary near,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I dare for once prescribe for your disease,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And save long bills, and a damned doctor's fees.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And both at hand, (for in our yard they grow,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of yellow choler, and of melancholy:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You must both purge and vomit; but obey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And for the love of heaven make no delay.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since hot and dry in your complexion join,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beware the sun when in a vernal sign;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For when he mounts exalted in the Ram,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If then he finds your body in a flame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A tertian ague is at least your lot.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Perhaps a fever (which the Gods forefend)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">May bring your youth to some untimely end:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And therefore, sir, as you desire to live,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A day or two before your laxative,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Take just three worms, nor under nor above,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because the Gods unequal numbers love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These digestives prepare you for your purge;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of fumetery, centaury, and spurge,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And of ground-ivy add a leaf, or two,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All which within our yard or garden grow.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your father's son was never born to fear.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Madam, quoth he, gramercy for your care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Cato, whom you quoted, you may spare.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis true, a wise and worthy man he seems,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And (as you say) gave no belief to dreams;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And, by the immortal powers, as wise as he,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Maintain, with sounder sense, that dreams forebode;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For Homer plainly says they come from God.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor Cato said it; but some modern fool</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Imposed in Cato's name on boys at school.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Believe me, madam, morning dreams foreshow</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The events of things, and future weal or woe:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some truths are not by reason to be tried,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But we have sure experience for our guide.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An ancient author,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> equal with the best,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Relates this tale of dreams among the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Two friends or brothers, with devout intent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On some far pilgrimage together went.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It happened so, that, when the sun was down,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They just arrived by twilight at a town;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That day had been the baiting of a bull,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas at a feast, and every inn so full,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That no void room in chamber, or on ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And but one sorry bed was to be found;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And that so little it would hold but one,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though till this hour they never lay alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">So were they forced to part; one staid behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His fellow sought what lodging he could find:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At last he found a stall where oxen stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And that he rather chose than lie abroad.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas in a farther yard without a door;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, for his ease, well littered was the floor.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His fellow, who the narrow bed had kept,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was weary, and without a rocker slept:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Supine he snored; but in the dead of night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He dreamt his friend appeared before his sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, with a ghastly look and doleful cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Said, help me, brother, or this night I die:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arise, and help, before all help be vain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or in an ox's stall I shall be slain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Rouzed from his rest, he wakened in a start,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shivering with horror, and with aching heart;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At length to cure himself by reason tries;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Twas but a dream, and what are dreams but lies?</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So thinking changed his side, and closed his eyes.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His dream returns; his friend appears again:</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The murderers come, now help, or I am slain:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Twas but a vision still, and visions are but vain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He dreamt the third; but now his friend appeared</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pale, naked, pierced with wounds, with blood besmeared:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thrice warned, awake, said he; relief is late,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The deed is done; but thou revenge my fate:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tardy of aid, unseal thy heavy eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Awake, and with the dawning day arise:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take to the western gate thy ready way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For by that passage they my corpse convey:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My corpse is in a tumbrel laid, among</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The filth, and ordure, and inclosed with dung.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That cart arrest, and raise a common cry;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sacred hunger of my gold I die:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Then shewed his grisly wounds; and last he drew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A piteous sigh, and took a long adieu.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The frighted friend arose by break of day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And found the stall where late his fellow lay.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then of his impious host inquiring more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was answered that his guest was gone before:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Muttering he went, said he, by morning light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And much complained of his ill rest by night.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This raised suspicion in the pilgrim's mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because all hosts are of an evil kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And oft to share the spoil with robbers joined.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His dream confirmed his thought; with troubled look</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Straight to the western gate his way he took;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There, as his dream foretold, a cart he found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That carried compost forth to dung the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This when the pilgrim saw, he stretched his throat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cried out murder with a yelling note.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My murdered fellow in this cart lies dead;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Vengeance and justice on the villain's head!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You, magistrates, who sacred laws dispense,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On you I call to punish this offence.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The word thus given, within a little space,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mob came roaring out, and thronged the place.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All in a trice they cast the cart to ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And in the dung the murdered body found;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though breathless, warm, and reeking from the wound.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Good heaven, whose darling attribute we find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is boundless grace, and mercy to mankind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Abhors the cruel; and the deeds of night</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By wondrous ways reveals in open light:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Murder may pass unpunished for a time,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But tardy justice will o'ertake the crime.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And oft a speedier pain the guilty feels,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The hue and cry of heaven pursues him at the heels,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fresh from the fact, as in the present case:</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The criminals are seized upon the place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Carter and host confronted face to face.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stiff in denial, as the law appoints,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On engines they distend their tortured joints;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So was confession forced, the offence was known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And public justice on the offenders done.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Here may you see that visions are to dread;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in the page that follows this, I read</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of two young merchants, whom the hope of gain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Induced in partnership to cross the main;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Waiting till willing winds their sails supplied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Within a trading-town they long abide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Full fairly situate on a haven's side.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">One evening it befel, that, looking out,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wind they long had wished was come about;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well pleased they went to rest; and if the gale</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till morn continued, both resolved to sail.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But as together in a bed they lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The younger had a dream at break of day.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A man, he thought, stood frowning at his side,</span>}<br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who warned him for his safety to provide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor put to sea, but safe on shore abide.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I come, thy genius, to command thy stay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Trust not the winds, for fatal is the day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And death unhoped<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> attends the watry way.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">The vision said, and vanished from his sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dreamer wakened in a mortal fright;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then pulled his drowsy neighbour, and declared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What in his slumber he had seen and heard.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His friend smiled scornful, and, with proud contempt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stay, who will stay; for me no fears restrain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who follow Mercury, the god of gain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Let each man do as to his fancy seems,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I wait not, I, till you have better dreams.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dreams are but interludes, which fancy makes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When monarch reason sleeps, this mimic wakes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Compounds a medley of disjointed things,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A mob of coblers, and a court of kings:<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Light fumes are merry, grosser fumes are sad;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both are the reasonable soul run mad;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And many monstrous forms in sleep we see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That neither were, nor are, nor e'er can be.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sometimes, forgotten things long cast behind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rush forward in the brain, and come to mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The nurse's legends are for truths received,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the man dreams but what the boy believed.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes we but rehearse a former play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The night restores our actions done by day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As hounds in sleep will open for their prey.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In short, the farce of dreams is of a piece,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Chimeras all; and more absurd, or less.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You, who believe in tales, abide alone;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whate'er I get this voyage is my own.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Thus while he spoke, he heard the shouting crew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That called aboard, and took his last adieu.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The vessel went before a merry gale,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And for quick passage put on every sail;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when least feared, and even in open day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mischief overtook her in the way:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whether she sprung a leak, I cannot find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or whether she was overset with wind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or that some rock below her bottom rent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But down at once with all the crew she went.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her fellow-ships from far her loss descried;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But only she was sunk, and all were safe beside.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">By this example you are taught again,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That dreams and visions are not always vain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But if, dear Partlet, you are yet in doubt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Another tale shall make the former out.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Kenelm, the son of Kenulph, Mercia's king,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose holy life the legends loudly sing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Warned in a dream, his murder did foretel,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From point to point as after it befel:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All circumstances to his nurse he told,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A wonder from a child of seven years old;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dream with horror heard, the good old wife</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From treason counselled him to guard his life;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But close to keep the secret in his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For a boy's vision small belief would find.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The pious child, by promise bound, obeyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor was the fatal murder long delayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Quenda slain, he fell before his time,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made a young martyr by his sister's crime.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The tale is told by venerable Bede,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which, at your better leisure, you may read.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Macrobius too relates the vision sent</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To the great Scipio, with the famed event;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Objections makes, but after makes replies,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And adds, that dreams are often prophecies.</span><br />

  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of Daniel you may read in holy writ,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who, when the king his vision did forget,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Could word for word the wondrous dream repeat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor less of patriarch Joseph understand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who by a dream enslaved the Egyptian land,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The years of plenty and of death foretold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When, for their bread, their liberty they sold.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor must the exalted butler be forgot,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor he whose dream presaged his hanging lot.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And did not Cr&#339;sus the same death foresee,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Raised in his vision on a lofty tree?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wife of Hector, in his utmost pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dreamt of his death the night before he died:<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Well was he warned from battle to refrain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But men to death decreed are warned in vain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He dared the dream, and by his fatal foe was slain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Much more I know, which I forbear to speak,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For see the ruddy day begins to break:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Let this suffice, that plainly I foresee</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My dream was bad, and bodes adversity;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But neither pills nor laxatives I like,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They only serve to make a well-man sick;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of these his gain the sharp physician makes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And often gives a purge, but seldom takes;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">They not correct, but poison all the blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And ne'er did any but the doctors good.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their tribe, trade, trinkets, I defy them all,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With every work of 'pothecary's hall.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">These melancholy matters I forbear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But let me tell thee, Partlet mine, and swear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That when I view the beauties of thy face,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Madam, the meaning of this Latin is,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That woman is to man his sovereign bliss.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For when by night I feel your tender side,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">That all my boding cares are cast behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And even already I forget my dream.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He said, and downward flew from off the beam,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For day light now began apace to spring,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The thrush to whistle, and the lark to sing.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then crowing, clapped his wings, the appointed call,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To chuck his wives together in the hall.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">By this the widow had unbarred the door,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Chanticleer went strutting out before,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">With royal courage, and with heart so light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As shewed he scorned the visions of the night.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now roaming in the yard, he spurned the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And gave to Partlet the first grain he found.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then often feathered her with wanton play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And trod her twenty times ere prime of day;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And took by turns and gave so much delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her sisters pined with envy at the sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He chucked again, when other corns he found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And scarcely deigned to set a foot to ground;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But swaggered like a lord about his hall,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And his seven wives came running at his call.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">'Twas now the month in which the world began,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(If March beheld the first created man;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And since the vernal equinox, the sun</span><br />

  <span class="i0">When casting up his eyes against the light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both month, and day, and hour, he measured right,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And told more truly than the Ephemeris;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For art may err, but nature cannot miss.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus numbering times and seasons in his breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His second crowing the third hour confessed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then turning, said to Partlet,&mdash;See, my dear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How lavish nature has adorned the year;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How the pale primrose and blue violet spring,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">An unfledged creature, of a lumpish frame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Endued with fewer particles of flame:</span><br />

  <span class="i0">I draw fresh air, and nature's works admire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And even this day in more delight abound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than, since I was an egg, I ever found.&mdash;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Yet fearing to be seen, within a bed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of coleworts he concealed his wily head;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There sculked till afternoon, and watched his time,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(As murderers use,) to perpetrate his crime.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">O hypocrite, ingenious to destroy!</span><br />

  <span class="i0">O Chanticleer, in an unhappy hour</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And not that day descended from the beam!</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But here the doctors eagerly dispute;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some hold predestination absolute;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some clerks maintain, that Heaven at first foresees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in the virtue of foresight decrees.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If this be so, then prescience binds the will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And mortals are not free to good or ill;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For what he first foresaw, he must ordain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or its eternal prescience may be vain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As bad for us as prescience had not been;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For first, or last, he's author of the sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And who says that, let the blaspheming man</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Say worse even of the devil, if he can.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For how can that Eternal Power be just</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To punish man, who sins because he must?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or, how can he reward a virtuous deed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which is not done by us, but first decreed?</span><br />
  <span class="i1">I cannot bolt this matter to the bran,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As Bradwardin<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and holy Austin can:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If prescience can determine actions so,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That we must do, because he did foreknow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or that foreknowing, yet our choice is free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not forced to sin by strict necessity;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">This strict necessity they simple call,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Another sort there is conditional.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The first so binds the will, that things foreknown</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By spontaneity, not choice, are done.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus galley-slaves tug willing at their oar,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Heaven made us agents free to good or ill,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And forced it not, though he foresaw the will.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Freedom was first bestowed on human race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And prescience only held the second place.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">If he could make such agents wholly free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I not dispute; the point's too high for me:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For heaven's unfathomed power what man can sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or put to his omnipotence a bound?</span><br />

  <span class="i0">For women, with a mischief to their kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pervert, with bad advice, our better mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A woman's counsel brought us first to woe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made her man his paradise forego,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where at heart's ease he lived; and might have been</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As free from sorrow as he was from sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For what the devil had their sex to do,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, born to folly, they presumed to know,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And could not see the serpent in the grass?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But I myself presume, and let it pass.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Silence in times of suffering is the best,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Tis dangerous to disturb a hornet's nest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In other authors you may find enough,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all they say of dames is idle stuff.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Legends of lying wits together bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wife of Bath would throw them to the ground:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These are the words of Chanticleer, not mine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I honour dames, and think their sex divine.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Now to continue what my tale begun.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lay madam Partlet basking in the sun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Breast-high in sand; her sisters, in a row,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enjoyed the beams above, the warmth below.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The cock, that of his flesh was ever free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And so befel, that as he cast his eye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Among the colworts, on a butterfly,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He saw false Reynard where he lay full low;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I need not swear he had no list to crow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But cried, <em>cock, cock</em>, and gave a sudden start,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As sore dismayed and frighted at his heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For birds and beasts, informed by nature, know</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Kinds opposite to theirs, and fly their foe.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So Chanticleer, who never saw a fox,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet shunned him, as a sailor shuns the rocks.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But the false loon, who could not work his will</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By open force, employed his flattering skill:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I hope, my lord, said he, I not offend;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Are you afraid of me, that am your friend?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I were a beast indeed to do you wrong,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I, who have loved and honoured you so long:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stay, gentle Sir, nor take a false alarm,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, on my soul, I never meant you harm!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I come no spy, nor as a traitor press,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To learn the secrets of your soft recess:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Far be from Reynard so profane a thought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But by the sweetness of your voice was brought:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, as I bid my beads, by chance I heard</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The song as of an angel in the yard;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A song that would have charmed the infernal gods,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And banished horror from the dark abodes:</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The wife had been detained, to keep the husband there.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">My lord, your sire familiarly I knew,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">He, with your lady-mother, (whom heaven rest!)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Has often graced my house, and been my guest:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To view his living features does me good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For I am your poor neighbour in the wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in my cottage should be proud to see</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The worthy heir of my friend's family.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But since I speak of singing, let me say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As with an upright heart I safely may,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, save yourself, there breathes not on the ground</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One like your father for a silver sound.</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So sweetly would he wake the winter-day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That matrons to the church mistook their way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And thought they heard the merry organ play.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And he to raise his voice with artful care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(What will not beaux attempt to please the fair?)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And stretched his comely neck at all the length:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And while he strained his voice to pierce the skies,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As saints in raptures use, would shut his eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That the sound striving through the narrow throat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His winking might avail to mend the note.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By this, in song, he never had his peer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From sweet Cecilia down to Chanticleer;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not Maro's muse, who sung the mighty man,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">That of a parish priest the son and heir,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Make hills and dales, and earth and heaven, rejoice,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And emulate your father's angel-voice.&mdash;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Nor could the treason from the truth descry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So was he ravished with this flattery:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So much the more, as from a little elf,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He had a high opinion of himself;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though sickly, slender, and not large of limb,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Concluding all the world was made for him.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Ye princes, raised by poets to the gods,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Alexandered up in lying odes,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And he shall be received with more regard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And listened to, than modest truth is heard.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This Chanticleer, of whom the story sings,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stood high upon his toes, and clapped his wings;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then stretched his neck, and winked with both his eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ambitious, as he sought the Olympic prize.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But while he pained himself to raise his note,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">False Reynard rushed, and caught him by the throat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then on his back he laid the precious load,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sought his wonted shelter of the wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Swiftly he made his way, the mischief done,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of all unheeded, and pursued by none.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Alas! what stay is there in human state,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">Whom, when the traitor safe on tree beheld,</span><br />

<h3><span class="smallish">THE</span><br />
FLOWER AND THE LEAF.</h3>


<p>The argument of this piece, as given by the editors of Chaucer,
runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>A gentlewoman, out of an arbour, in a grove, seeth a great
company of knights and ladies in a dance, upon the green grass.
The which being ended, they all kneel down, and do honour to the
daisy, some to the flower, and some to the leaf. Afterwards this
gentlewoman learneth, by one of these ladies, the meaning hereof,
which is this: They which honour the flower, a thing fading with
every blast, are such as look after beauty and worldly pleasure;
but they that honour the leaf, which abideth with the root, notwithstanding
the frosts and winter storms, are they which follow
virtue and during qualities, without regard of worldly respects.</em>"</p>

<p>Some farther allegory was perhaps implied in this poem. Froissart,
and other French poets, had established a sort of romantic
devotion to the <em>marguerite</em>, or daisy, probably because the homage
was capable of being allegorically transferred to any distinguished
lady bearing that name. Chaucer might obliquely insinuate the
superior valour of the warriors, and virtue of the ladies of Albion,
by proposing to them the worship of the laurel, as a more worthy
object of devotion than the flower. Nor is this interpretation
absolutely disproved by the homage which Chaucer himself pays
to the daisy in the Legend of Alcestis.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> A poet is no more obliged
to be consistent in his mythological creed, than constant in his devotion
to one beauty, and may shift from the Grecian to the Gothic
creed, or from the worship of Venus to that of Bellona. If every
separate poem is consistent with itself, it would be hard to require
any further uniformity.</p>

<p>Mr Godwin has elegantly and justly characterized the present
version:&mdash;"The poem of the 'Floure and the Lefe' is a production
of Chaucer, with which Dryden was 'so particularly pleased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
both for the invention and the moral,' as to induce him to
transfuse it into modern English. He has somewhat obscured the
purpose of the tale, which in the original is defective in perspicuity;
but he has greatly heightened the enchantment of its character.
He has made its personages fairies, who annually hold a
jubilee, such as is here described, on the first of May; Chaucer
had left the species of the beings he employs vague and unexplained.
In a word, the poem of Dryden, regarded merely as the exhibition
of a soothing and delicious luxuriance of fancy, may be
classed with the most successful productions of human genius."

  <span class="i0">Joy spreads the heart, and, with a general song,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Spring issues out, and leads the jolly months along.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">In that sweet season, as in bed I lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sought in sleep to pass the night away,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I turned my weary<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> side, but still in vain,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Cares I had none, to keep me from my rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For love had never entered in my breast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I wanted nothing fortune could supply,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor did she slumber till that hour deny.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I wondered then, but after found it true,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">When Chanticleer the second watch had sung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Scorning the scorner sleep, from bed I sprung;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And dressing, by the moon, in loose array,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Passed out in open air, preventing day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And sought a goodly grove, as fancy led my way.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Straight as a line in beauteous order stood</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of oaks unshorn, a venerable wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fresh was the grass beneath, and every tree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At distance planted in a due degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their branching arms in air with equal space</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stretched to their neighbours with a long embrace:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the new leaves on every bough were seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some ruddy-coloured, some of lighter green.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The painted birds, companions of the spring,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hopping from spray to spray, were heard to sing.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both eyes and ears received a like delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enchanting music, and a charming sight,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">On Philomel I fixed my whole desire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And listened for the queen of all the quire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wanted yet an omen to the spring.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Attending long in vain, I took the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which through a path, but scarcely printed, lay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In narrow mazes oft it seemed to meet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And looked as lightly pressed by fairy feet.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wandering I walked alone, for still methought</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To some strange end so strange a path was wrought:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At last it led me where an arbour stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sacred receptacle of the wood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This place unmarked, though oft I walked the green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In all my progress I had never seen;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And seized at once with wonder and delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Gazed all around me, new to the transporting sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas benched with turf, and, goodly to be seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The thick young grass arose in fresher green:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mound was newly made, no sight could pass</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The well-united sods so closely lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all around the shades defended it from day;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For sycamores with eglantine were spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A hedge about the sides, a covering over head.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And so the fragrant brier was wove between,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That nature seemed to vary the delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And satisfied at once the smell and sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The master workman of the bower was known</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through fairy-lands, and built for Oberon;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who twining leaves with such proportion drew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They rose by measure, and by rule they grew;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For none but hands divine could work so well.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both roof and sides were like a parlour made</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A soft recess, and a cool summer shade;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The hedge was set so thick, no foreign eye</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The persons placed within it could espy;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all that passed without with ease was seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if nor fence nor tree was placed between.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas bordered with a field; and some was plain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With grass, and some was sowed with rising grain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That (now the dew with spangles decked the ground)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sweeter spot of earth was never found.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I looked and looked, and still with new delight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such joy my soul, such pleasures filled my sight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose odours were of power to raise from death.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor sullen discontent, nor anxious care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even though brought thither, could inhabit there:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But thence they fled as from their mortal foe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this sweet place could only pleasure know.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus as I mused, I cast aside my eye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The spreading branches made a goodly shew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And full of opening blooms was every bough:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A goldfinch there I saw with gaudy pride</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of painted plumes, that hopped from side to side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still pecking as she passed; and still she drew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sweets from every flower, and sucked the dew:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sufficed at length, she warbled in her throat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And tuned her voice to many a merry note,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But indistinct, and neither sweet nor clear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet such as soothed my soul, and pleased my ear.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Her short performance was no sooner tried,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When she I sought, the nightingale, replied:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That the grove echoed, and the valleys rung;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And I so ravished with her heavenly note,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I stood entranced, and had no room for thought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all o'er-powered with ecstasy of bliss,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was in a pleasing dream of paradise;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">At length I waked, and, looking round the bower,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Searched every tree, and pryed on every flower,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If any where by chance I might espy</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rural poet of the melody;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For still methought she sung not far away:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At last I found her on a laurel spray.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Close by my side she sate, and fair in sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Full in a line, against her opposite;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And both their native sweets were well conjoined.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">On the green bank I sat, and listened long;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Sitting was more convenient for the song:)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor till her lay was ended could I move,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But wished to dwell for ever in the grove.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Only methought the time too swiftly passed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And every note I feared would be the last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My sight, and smell, and hearing, were employed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all three senses in full gust enjoyed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And what alone did all the rest surpass,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sweet possession of the fairy place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Single and conscious to myself alone</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pleasures which no where else were to be found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all Elysium in a spot of ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus while I sat intent to see and hear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And drew perfumes of more than vital air,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All suddenly I heard the approaching sound</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of vocal music, on the enchanted ground:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An host of saints it seemed, so full the quire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As if the blessed above did all conspire</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To join their voices, and neglect the lyre.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length there issued from the grove behind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A fair assembly of the female kind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A train less fair, as ancient fathers tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I pass their forms, and every charming grace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Less than an angel would their worth debase:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">But their attire, like liveries of a kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All rich and rare, is fresh within my mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In velvet white as snow the troop was gowned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The seams with sparkling emeralds set around:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their hoods and sleeves the same; and purfled o'er</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With diamonds, pearls, and all the shining store</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of eastern pomp: their long-descending train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With rubies edged, and sapphires, swept the plain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">High on their heads, with jewels richly set,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each lady wore a radiant coronet.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beneath the circles, all the quire was graced</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of laurel some, of woodbine many more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wreaths of <em>Agnus castus</em> others bore:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These last, who with those virgin crowns were dressed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Appeared in higher honour than the rest.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They danced around; but in the midst was seen</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A lady of a more majestic mien;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By stature, and by beauty, marked their sovereign queen.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">She in the midst began with sober grace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her servants' eyes were fixed upon her face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as she moved or turned, her motions viewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her measures kept and step by step pursued.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Methought she trod the ground with greater grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With more of godhead shining in her face;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as in beauty she surpassed the quire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So, nobler than the rest was her attire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A crown of ruddy gold inclosed her brow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Plain without pomp, and rich without a show:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A branch of <em>Agnus castus</em> in her hand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She bore aloft (her sceptre of command;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Admired, adored by all the circling crowd,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For wheresoe'er she turned her face, they bowed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as she danced, a roundelay she sung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In honour of the laurel, ever young:</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She raised her voice on high, and sung so clear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And all the bending forest lent an ear.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At every close she made, the attending throng</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Replied, and bore the burden of the song:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So just, so small, yet in so sweet a note,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It seemed the music melted in the throat.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus dancing on, and singing as they danced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They to the middle of the mead advanced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till round my arbour a new ring they made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And footed it about the secret shade.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O'erjoyed to see the jolly troop so near,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But somewhat awed, I shook with holy fear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet not so much, but that I noted well</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who did the most in song or dance excel.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Not long I had observed, when from afar</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I heard a sudden symphony of war;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The neighing coursers, and the soldiers' cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sounding trumps that seemed to tear the sky:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I saw soon after this, behind the grove</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From whence the ladies did in order move,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Come issuing out in arms a warrior train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That like a deluge poured upon the plain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On barbed steeds they rode in proud array,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thick as the college of the bees in May,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">New to the flowers, and intercept the sky.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So fierce they drove, their coursers were so fleet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That the turf trembled underneath their feet.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To tell their costly furniture were long,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The summer's day would end before the song:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To purchase but the tenth of all their store,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet what I can, I will: before the rest</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The trumpets issued in white mantles dressed;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A numerous troop, and all their heads around</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With chaplets green of cerrial-oak were crowned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And at each trumpet was a banner bound;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Which, waving in the wind, displayed at large</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their master's coat-of-arms, and knightly charge.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Broad were the banners, and of snowy hue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A purer web the silk-worm never drew.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With orient pearls and jewels powdered o'er:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Broad were their collars too, and every one</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was set about with many a costly stone.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Next these, of kings-at-arms a goodly train</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In proud array came prancing o'er the plain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their cloaks were cloth of silver mixed with gold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And garlands green around their temples rolled:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With sapphires, diamonds, and with rubies graced:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as the trumpets their appearance made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So these in habits were alike arrayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But with a pace more sober, and more slow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And twenty, rank in rank, they rode a-row.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The pursuivants came next, in number more;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And like the heralds each his scutcheon bore:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Clad in white velvet all their troop they led,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With each an oaken chaplet on his head.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In golden armour glorious to behold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rivets<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> of their arms were nailed with gold.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Their surcoats of white ermine-fur were made;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With cloth of gold between, that cast a glittering shade.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The trappings of their steeds were of the same;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The golden fringe even set the ground on flame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And drew a precious trail: a crown divine</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of laurel did about their temples twine.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Three henchmen<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> were for every knight assigned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All in rich livery clad, and of a kind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">White velvet, but unshorn, for cloaks they wore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And each within his hand a truncheon bore:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The foremost held a helm of rare device;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A prince's ransom would not pay the price.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second bore the buckler of his knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The third of cornel-wood a spear upright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Headed with piercing steel, and polished bright.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like to their lords their equipage was seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all their foreheads crowned with garlands green.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And after these came armed with spear and shield</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An host so great, as covered all the field:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all their foreheads, like the knights' before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With laurels ever-green were shaded o'er,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or oak, or other leaves of lasting kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tenacious of the stem, and firm against the wind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some in their hands, beside the lance and shield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The boughs of woodbine or of hawthorn held,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Or branches for their mystic emblems took,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of palm, of laurel, or of cerrial oak.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus marching to the trumpet's lofty sound,&nbsp;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Drawn in two lines adverse they wheeled around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And in the middle meadow took their ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Among themselves the tourney they divide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In equal squadrons ranged on either side;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then turned their horses' heads, and man to man,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And steed to steed opposed, the justs began.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They lightly set their lances in the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, at the sign, against each other pressed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They met. I sitting at my ease beheld</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mixed events, and fortunes of the field.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some broke their spears, some tumbled horse and man,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And round the fields the lightened coursers ran.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An hour and more, like tides, in equal sway</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They rushed, and won by turns, and lost the day:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At length the nine (who still together held)</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their fainting foes to shameful flight compelled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And with resistless force o'er-ran the field.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus, to their fame, when finished was the fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The victors from their lofty steeds alight:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like them dismounted all the warlike train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And two by two proceeded o'er the plain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till to the fair assembly they advanced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who near the secret arbour sung and danced.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ladies left their measures at the sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To meet the chiefs returning from the fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And each with open arms embraced her chosen knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The grace and ornament of all the wood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That pleasing shade they sought, a soft retreat</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From sudden April showers, a shelter from the heat:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her leafy arms with such extent were spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So near the clouds was her aspiring head,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">That hosts of birds, that wing the liquid air,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Perched in the boughs, had nightly lodging there:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Might hear the rattling hail, and wintry war;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From heaven's inclemency here found retreat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enjoyed the cool, and shunned the scorching heat:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A hundred knights might there at ease abide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And every knight a lady by his side:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The trunk itself such odours did bequeath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That a Moluccan breeze to these was common breath.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The lords and ladies here, approaching, paid</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their homage, with a low obeisance made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And seemed to venerate the sacred shade.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These rites performed, their pleasures they pursue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With songs of love, and mix with measures<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> new;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Around the holy tree their dance they frame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And every champion leads his chosen dame.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">I cast my sight upon the farther field,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And a fresh object of delight beheld:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For from the region of the west I heard</span><br />
  <span class="i0">New music sound, and a new troop appeared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of knights, and ladies mixed a jolly band,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all on foot they marched, and hand in hand.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ladies dressed in rich symars were seen</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of Florence sattin, flowered with white and green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The borders of their petticoats below</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were guarded thick with rubies on a row;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And every damsel wore upon her head</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of flowers a garland blended white and red.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Attired in mantles all the knights were seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That gratified the view with cheerful green:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their chaplets of their ladies' colours were,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Composed of white and red, to shade their shining hair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before the merry troop the minstrels played;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All in their masters' liveries were arrayed,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And clad in green, and on their temples wore</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chaplets white and red their ladies bore.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their instruments were various in their kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some for the bow, and some for breathing wind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sawtry,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> pipe, and hautboy's noisy band,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They saw, and thitherward they bent their way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To this both knights and dames their homage made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And due obeisance to the daisy paid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And then the band of flutes began to play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To which a lady sung a virelay:<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">And still at every close she would repeat</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The burden of the song, <em>The daisy is so sweet</em>.</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><em>The daisy is so sweet</em>, when she begun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The troop of knights and dames continued on.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The concert and the voice so charmed my ear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And soothed my soul, that it was heaven to hear.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But soon their pleasure passed; at noon of day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sun with sultry beams began to play:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then drooped the fading flowers (their beauty fled)</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And closed their sickly eyes, and hung the head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, rivelled up with heat, lay dying in their bed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ladies gasped, and scarcely could respire</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The breath they drew, no longer air but fire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fainty knights were scorched; and knew not where</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To run for shelter, for no shade was near.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And after this the gathering clouds amain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Poured down a storm of rattling hail and rain;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And lightning flashed betwixt: the field, and flowers,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Burnt up before, were buried in the showers.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ladies and the knights, no shelter nigh,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bare to the weather and the wintry sky,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were dropping wet, disconsolate, and wan,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And through their thin array received the rain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While those in white, protected by the tree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Saw pass the vain assault, and stood from danger free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But as compassion moved their gentle minds,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When ceased the storm, and silent were the winds,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Displeased at what, not suffering, they had seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They went to cheer the faction of the green:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The queen in white array, before her band,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Saluting, took her rival by the hand;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So did the knights and dames, with courtly grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fair sister, I have suffered in your woe;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor shall be wanting aught within my power</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For your relief in my refreshing bower.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That other answered with a lowly look,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And soon the gracious invitation took:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For ill at ease both she and all her train</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The scorching sun had borne, and beating rain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like courtesy was used by all in white,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Each dame a dame received, and every knight a knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The laurel champions with their swords invade</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The neighboring forests, where the justs were made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sere wood from the rotten hedges took,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And seeds of latent fire from flints provoke:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A cheerful blaze arose, and by the fire</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They warmed their frozen feet, and dried their wet attire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Refreshed with heat, the ladies sought around</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For virtuous herbs, which gathered from the ground</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">They squeezed the juice, and cooling ointment made,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which on their sun-burnt cheeks, and their chapt skins, they laid;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then sought green sallads, which they bade them eat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A sovereign remedy for inward heat.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The Lady of the Leaf ordained a feast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made the Lady of the Flower her guest:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When lo, a bower ascended on the plain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With sudden seats adorned, and large for either train.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That I could hear and see whatever passed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ladies sat with each a knight between,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Distinguished by their colours, white and green;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The vanquished party with the victors joined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor wanted sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Meantime the minstrels played on either side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Vain of their art, and for the mastery vied:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sweet contention lasted for an hour,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And reached my secret arbour from the bower.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The sun was set; and Vesper, to supply</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His absent beams, had lighted up the sky:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When Philomel, officious all the day</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To sing the service of the ensuing May,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fled from her laurel shade, and winged her flight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Directly to the queen arrayed in white;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And hopping sat familiar on her hand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A new musician, and increased the band.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The goldfinch, who, to shun the scalding heat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had changed the medlar for a safer seat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And hid in bushes 'scaped the bitter shower,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now perched upon the Lady of the Flower;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And either songster holding out their throats,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And folding up their wings, renewed their notes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if all day, preluding to the fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They only had rehearsed, to sing by night.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The banquet ended, and the battle done,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They danced by star-light and the friendly moon:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And when they were to part, the laureat queen</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Supplied with steeds the lady of the green.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her and her train conducting on the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The moon to follow, and avoid the day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This when I saw, inquisitive to know</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret moral of the mystic show,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I started from my shade, in hopes to find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as my fair adventure fell, I found</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A lady all in white, with laurel crowned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who closed the rear, and softly paced along,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Repeating to herself the former song.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With due respect my body I inclined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As to some being of superior kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made my court according to the day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wishing her queen and her a happy May.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Great thanks, my daughter, with a gracious bow</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She said; and I, who much desired to know</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of whence she was, yet fearful how to break</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My mind, adventured humbly thus to speak:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Madam, might I presume and not offend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So may the stars and shining moon attend</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your nightly sports, as you vouchsafe to tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And what the knights who fought in listed fields so well.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To this the dame replied: Fair daughter, know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That what you saw was all a fairy show;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all those airy shapes you now behold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were human bodies once, and clothed with earthly mold:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Our souls, not yet prepared for upper light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till doomsday wander in the shades of night;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This only holiday of all the year,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">We, privileged, in sunshine may appear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With songs and dance we celebrate the day,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with due honours usher in the May.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">At other times we reign by night alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And posting through the skies pursue the moon;</span><br />

  <span class="i1">All courteous are by kind; and ever proud</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With friendly offices to help the good.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In every land we have a larger space</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Know farther; every lady clothed in white,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Are servants to the leaf, by liveries known</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of innocence; and I myself am one.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Saw you not her so graceful to behold</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In white attire, and crowned with radiant gold?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sovereign lady of our land is she,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Diana called, the queen of chastity;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, for the spotless name of maid she bears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That <em>Agnus castus</em> in her hand appears;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all her train, with leafy chaplets crowned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were for unblamed virginity renowned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But those the chief and highest in command</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who bear those holy branches in their hand:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The knights adorned with laurel crowns are they,</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Victorious names, who made the world obey:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, while they lived, in deeds of arms excelled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And after death for deities were held.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But those, who wear the woodbine on their brow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were knights of love, who never broke their vow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Firm to their plighted faith, and ever free</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From fears, and fickle chance, and jealousy.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The lords and ladies, who the woodbine bear,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur's reign,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The laurel wreaths were first by Cæsar worn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And still they Cæsar's successors adorn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One leaf of this is immortality,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">One doubt remains, said I; the dames in green,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What were their qualities, and who their queen?&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Flora commands, said she, those nymphs and knights,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who never acts of honour durst pursue,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Who, nursed in idleness, and trained in courts,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Passed all their precious hours in plays and sports,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till death behind came stalking on, unseen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And withered (like the storm) the freshness of their green.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These, and their mates, enjoy the present hour,</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But knights in knightly deeds should persevere,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Demanded till the next returning May,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whether the leaf or flower I would obey?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I chose the leaf; she smiled with sober cheer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wished me fair adventure for the year,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And gave me charms and sigils, for defence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Against ill tongues that scandal innocence:&mdash;</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And met the merry crew, who danced about the May.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then late refreshed with sleep, I rose to write</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The visionary vigils of the night.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Blush, as thou may'st, my little book, for shame,</span><br />

<h3>THE WIFE OF BATH.</h3>


<p>The original of this tale should probably be sought in some ancient
metrical romance. At least, we know, that there exists a ballad
connected with the Round Table Romances, entitled "The
Marriage of Sir Gawain," which seems to have been taken, not from
Chaucer, but some more ancient and romantic legend. Gower also
had seized upon this subject, and wrought it into the tale, entitled
"Florent," which is the most pleasing in his dull <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite>.
But what was a mere legendary tale of wonder in the rhime of the
minstrel, and a vehicle for trite morality in that of Gower, in the
verse of Chaucer reminds us of the resurrection of a skeleton, reinvested
by miracle with flesh, complexion, and powers of life and
motion. Of all Chaucer's multifarious powers, none is more wonderful
than the humour, with which he touched upon natural
frailty, and the truth with which he describes the inward feelings
of the human heart; at a time when all around were employed
in composing romantic legends, in which the real character of their
heroes was as effectually disguised by the stiffness of their manners,
as their shapes by the sharp angles and unnatural projections
of their plate armour.</p>

<p>Dryden, who probably did not like the story worse, that it contained
a passing satire against priests and women, has bestowed
considerable pains upon his version. It is, perhaps, not to be regretted,
that he left the Prologue to Pope, who has drawn a veil
over the coarse nakedness of Father Chaucer. The tale is characteristically
placed by the original author, in the mouth of the
buxom Wife of Bath, whose mode of governing her different husbands
is so ludicrously described in the Prologue.</p>

  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It so befel in this king Arthur's reign,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A bachelor he was, and of the courtly train.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It happened as he rode, a damsel gay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In russet robes, to market took her way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So straight she walked, and on her pasterns high:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If seeing her behind he liked her pace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now turning short, he better liked her face.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He lights in haste, and, full of youthful fire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By force accomplished his obscene desire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This done, away he rode, not unespied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, swarming at his back, the country cried;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, once in view, they never lost the sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But seized, and, pinioned, brought to court the knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then courts of kings were held in high renown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ere made the common brothels of the town;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There virgins honourable vows received,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But chaste as maids in monasteries lived;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The king himself, to nuptial ties a slave,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No bad example to his poets gave.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And they, not bad but in a vicious age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had not, to please the prince, debauched the stage.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></span><br />

  <span class="i1">Now, what should Arthur do? He loved the knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sovereign monarchs are the source of right:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Moved by the damsel's tears and common cry,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He doomed the brutal ravisher to die.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But fair Geneura<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> rose in his defence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And prayed so hard for mercy from the prince,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That to his queen the king the offender gave,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And left it in her power to kill or save.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This gracious act the ladies all approve,</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, with their mistress, joined in close debate,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And the fair speaker, rising from her chair,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And cannot blood, without a sigh, behold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I grant thee life; reserving still the power</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To take the forfeit when I see my hour;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unless thy answer to my next demand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shall set thee free from our avenging hand.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The question, whose solution I require,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is, what the sex of women most desire?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In this dispute thy judges are at strife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beware, for on thy wit depends thy life.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Yet (lest surprised, unknowing what to say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou damn thyself) we give thee farther day;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A year is thine to wander at thy will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And learn from others, if thou want'st the skill;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, not to hold our proffer'd turn in scorn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Good sureties will we have for thy return,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And at thy pledge's peril keep thy day.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Woe was the knight at this severe command,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The terms accepted, as the fair ordain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He put in bail for his return again;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And promised answer at the day assigned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The best, with heaven's assistance, he could find.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His leave thus taken, on his way he went&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Misdoubting much, and fearful of the event.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas hard the truth of such a point to find,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Thus on he went; still anxious more and more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Asked all he met, and knocked at every door;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Enquired of men; but made his chief request</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To learn from women what they loved the best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They answered each, according to her mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To please herself, not all the female kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One was for wealth, another was for place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Crones, old and ugly, wished a better face.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The widow's wish was oftentimes to wed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some gross flattery loved without disguise.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Truth is, says one, he seldom fails to win</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who flatters well; for that's our darling sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But long attendance, and a duteous mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Will work even with the wisest of the kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One thought the sex's prime felicity</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their pleasures, hours, and actions, all their own,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, uncontrouled, to give account to none.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some wish a husband-fool; but such are cursed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For fools perverse of husbands are the worst.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All women would be counted chaste and wise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor should our spouses see but with our eyes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For fools will prate; and though they want the wit</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To find close faults, yet open blots will hit;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though better for their ease to hold their tongue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For womankind was never in the wrong.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So noise ensues, and quarrels last for life;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wife abhors the fool, the fool the wife.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some men say, that great delight have we</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To be for truth extolled, and secrecy;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And constant in one purpose still to dwell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And not our husbands' counsels to reveal.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But that's a fable; for our sex is frail,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Inventing rather than not tell a tale.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like leaky sieves no secrets we can hold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Witness the famous tale that Ovid told.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i1">Midas the king, as in his book appears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By Ph&#339;bus was endowed with asses ears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which under his long locks he well concealed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(As monarchs' vices must not be revealed,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For fear the people have them in the wind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, long ago, were neither dumb nor blind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor apt to think from heaven their title springs,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This Midas knew; and durst communicate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To none but to his wife his ears of state;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One must be trusted, and he thought her fit,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As passing prudent, and a parlous wit.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">To this sagacious confessor he went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And told her what a gift the gods had sent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But told it under matrimonial seal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With strict injunction never to reveal.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret heard, she plighted him her troth,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(And sacred sure is every woman's oath,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The royal malady should rest unknown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both for her husband's honour and her own:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The counsel rumbled till it found a vent.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The thing she knew she was obliged to hide;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By interest and by oath the wife was tied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But, if she told it not, the woman died.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Loth to betray a husband and a prince,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But she must burst or blab, and no pretence</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A marshy ground commodiously was near,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thither she ran, and held her breath for fear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lest if a word she spoke of any thing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That word might be the secret of the king.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus full of counsel to the fen she went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Griped all the way, and longing for a vent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arrived, by pure necessity compelled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On her majestic marrow-bones she kneeled:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then to the water's brink she laid her head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as a bittour bumps<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> within a reed,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To thee alone, O lake! she said, I tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(And, as thy queen, command thee to conceal:)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beneath his locks, the king my husband wears</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A goodly royal pair of asses ears:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now I have eased my bosom of the pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till the next longing fit return again.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Thus through a woman was the secret known;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tell us, and, in effect, you tell the town.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But to my tale: The knight, with heavy cheer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wandering in vain, had now consumed the year;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One day was only left to solve the doubt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet knew no more than when he first set out.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But home he must; and, as the award had been,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yield up his body captive to the queen.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In this despairing state he hap'd to ride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As fortune led him, by a forest side;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lonely the vale, and full of horror stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Brown with the shade of a religious wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When full before him, at the noon of night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(The moon was up, and shot a gleamy light,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He saw a quire of ladies in a round,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That featly footing seemed to skim the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus dancing hand in hand, so light they were,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He knew not where they trod, on earth or air.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At speed he drove, and came a sudden guest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In hope, where many women were, at least</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some one, by chance, might answer his request.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But faster than his horse the ladies flew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in a trice were vanished out of view.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">One only hag remained; but fouler far</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than grandame apes in Indian forests are;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Against a withered oak she leaned her weight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Propped on her trusty staff, not half upright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And dropped an awkward courtesy to the knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then said, What makes you, sir, so late abroad</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Without a guide, and this no beaten road?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or want you aught that here you hope to find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or travel for some trouble in your mind?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The last I guess; and if I read aright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Those of our sex are bound to serve a knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then tell your pain, for wisdom is in age.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Then tell your pain, for wisdom is in age.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To this the knight: Good mother, would you know</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret cause and spring of all my woe?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My life must with to-morrow's light expire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unless I tell what women most desire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now could you help me at this hard essay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or for your inborn goodness, or for pay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yours is my life, redeemed by your advice,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ask what you please, and I will pay the price:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The proudest kerchief of the court shall rest</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Well satisfied of what they love the best.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Plight me thy faith, quoth she, that what I ask,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy danger over, and performed the task,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That shalt thou give for hire of thy demand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Here take thy oath, and seal it on my hand,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I warrant thee, on peril of my life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy words shall please both widow, maid, and wife.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">More words there needed not to move the knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To take her offer, and his truth to plight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With that she spread her mantle on the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, first inquiring whither he was bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bade him not fear, though long and rough the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At court he should arrive ere break of day:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His horse should find the way without a guide,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She said: with fury they began to ride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He on the midst, the beldam at his side.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The horse, what devil drove I cannot tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But only this, they sped their journey well;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all the way the crone informed the knight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">How he should answer the demand aright.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To court they came; the news was quickly spread</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of his returning to redeem his head.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The female senate was assembled soon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With all the mob of women in the town:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The queen sat lord chief-justice of the hall,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And bade the crier cite the criminal.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knight appeared, and silence they proclaim:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then first the culprit answered to his name;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And, after forms of law, was last required</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To name the thing that women most desired.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The offender, taught his lesson by the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And by his counsel ordered what to say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus bold began:&mdash;My lady liege, said he,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What all your sex desire is&mdash;<span class="smcap">sovereignty</span>.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wife affects her husband to command;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All must be her's, both money, house, and land:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The maids are mistresses even in their name,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And of their servants full dominion claim.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This, at the peril of my head, I say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A blunt plain truth, the sex aspires to sway,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You to rule all, while we, like slaves, obey.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">There was not one, or widow, maid, or wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But said the knight had well deserved his life.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even fair Geneura, with a blush, confessed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The man had found what women love the best.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Up starts the beldam, who was there unseen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, reverence made, accosted thus the queen:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My liege, said she, before the court arise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">May I, poor wretch, find favour in your eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To grant my just request: 'twas I who taught</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knight this answer, and inspired his thought.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">None but a woman could a man direct</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To tell us women what we most affect.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But first I swore him on his knightly troth,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(And here demand performance of his oath,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To grant the boon that next I should desire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He gave his faith, and I expect my hire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My promise is fulfilled: I saved his life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And claim his debt, to take me for his wife.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knight was asked, nor could his oath deny,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But hoped they would not force him to comply.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The women, who would rather wrest the laws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than let a sister-plaintiff lose the cause,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(As judges on the bench more gracious are,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And more attent to brothers of the bar,)</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Cried one and all, the suppliant should have right,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And to the grandame hag adjudged the knight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">In vain he sighed, and oft with tears desired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some reasonable suit might be required.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But still the crone was constant to her note;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The more he spoke, the more she stretched her throat.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In vain he proffered all his goods, to save</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His body, destined to that living grave.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And nothing but the man would serve her turn.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not all the wealth of eastern kings, said she,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Has power to part my plighted love, and me;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, old and ugly as I am, and poor,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet never will I break the faith I swore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For mine thou art by promise, during life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And I thy loving and obedient wife.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">My love! nay rather my damnation thou,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Said he: nor am I bound to keep my vow;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fiend thy sire has sent thee from below,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know?</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>

  <span class="i0">Both heard, the judge pronounced against the knight;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To pass the marriage-feast, and nuptial song:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mirth there was none, the man was <em>a-la-mort</em>,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">To bed they went, the bridegroom and the bride:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was never such an ill-paired couple tied!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Restless he tossed, and tumbled to and fro,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">With worse, begets a base degenerate breed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bad corrupts the good, and leaves behind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No trace of all the great begetter's mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The father sinks within his son, we see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And often rises in the third degree;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">If better luck a better mother give,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Chance gave us being, and by chance we live.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Such as our atoms were, even such are we,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or call it chance, or strong necessity:</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus loaded with dead weight, the will is free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thus it needs must be; for seed conjoined</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lets into nature's work the imperfect kind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But fire, the enlivener of the general frame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Is one, its operation still the same.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Its principle is in itself: while ours</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Works, as confederates war, with mingled powers;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or man or woman, which soever fails;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, oft, the vigour of the worse prevails.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Æther, with sulphur blended, alters hue,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus, in a brute, their ancient honour ends,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the fair mermaid in a fish descends:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The line is gone; no longer duke or earl;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, by himself degraded, turns a churl.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nobility of blood is but renown</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of thy great fathers by their virtue known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And a long trail of light, to thee descending down.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If in thy smoke it ends, their glories shine;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But infamy and villanage are thine.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then what I said before is plainly showed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That true nobility proceeds from God:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not left us by inheritance, but given</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By bounty of our stars, and grace of heaven.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fabricius from their walls repelled the foe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whose noble hands had exercised the plough.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From hence, my lord, and love, I thus conclude,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, though my homely ancestors were rude,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mean as I am, yet I may have the grace</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To make you father of a generous race.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And noble then am I, when I begin,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In virtue clothed, to cast the rags of sin.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If poverty be my upbraided crime,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And you believe in heaven, there was a time</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When he, the great controller of our fate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Deigned to be man, and lived in low estate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which he who had the world at his dispose,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If poverty were vice, would never choose.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Philosophers have said, and poets sing,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That a glad poverty's an honest thing;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Content is wealth, the riches of the mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And happy he who can that treasure find;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the base miser starves amidst his store,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Broods on his gold, and, griping still at more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ragged beggar, though he wants relief,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Want is a bitter and a hateful good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because its virtues are not understood.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet many things, impossible to thought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Have been, by need, to full perfection brought:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The daring of the soul proceeds from thence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sharpness of wit, and active diligence;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Prudence at once, and fortitude, it gives,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, if in patience taken, mends our lives;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For even that indigence, that brings me low,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Makes me myself, and him above, to know;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A good which none would challenge, few would choose,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A fair possession, which mankind refuse.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If we from wealth to poverty descend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">If I am old and ugly, well for you,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No lewd adulterer will my love pursue;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor jealousy, the bane of married life,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shall haunt you for a withered homely wife;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For age and ugliness, as all agree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Are the best guards of female chastity.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I'll do my best to further your content;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And therefore of two gifts in my dispose,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Think ere you speak,&mdash;I grant you leave to choose:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Would you I should be still deformed and old,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nauseous to touch, and loathsome to behold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On this condition, to remain for life</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A careful, tender, and obedient wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In all I can contribute to your ease,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And not in deed, or word, or thought displease?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or would you rather have me young and fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And take the chance that happens to your share?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Temptations are in beauty, and in youth.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And how can you depend upon my truth?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Sore sighed the knight, who this long sermon heard;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length considering all, his heart he cheered,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thus replied:&mdash;My lady, and my wife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To your wise conduct I resign my life:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Choose you for me, for well you understand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The future good and ill, on either hand:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But if an humble husband may request,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Provide, and order all things for the best;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your's be the care to profit, and to please,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And let your subject-servant take his ease.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then thus in peace, quoth she, concludes the strife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since I am turned the husband, you the wife:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The matrimonial victory is mine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which, having fairly gained, I will resign;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forgive, if I have said or done amiss,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And seal the bargain with a friendly kiss.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I promised you but one content to share,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But now I will become both good and fair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The business of my life shall be to please:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And for my beauty, that, as time shall try;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But draw the curtain first, and cast your eye.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He looked, and saw a creature heavenly fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In bloom of youth, and of a charming air.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With joy he turned, and seized her ivory arm;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, like Pygmalion, found the statue warm.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Small arguments there needed to prevail,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A storm of kisses poured as thick as hail.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And their first love continued to the last;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One sunshine was their life, no cloud between,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor ever was a kinder couple seen.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And so may all our lives like their's be led;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">May widows wed as often as they can,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And ever for the better change their man.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And some devouring plague pursue their lives,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who will not well be governed by their wives.</span><br />

<h3><span class="smallish">THE</span><br />
<br />
CHARACTER OF A GOOD PARSON.</h3>


<p>This beautiful copy of a beautiful original makes us regret,
that Dryden had not translated the whole Introduction to the
"Canterbury Tales," in which the pilgrims are so admirably described.
Something might have been lost for want of the ancient Gothic
lore, which the writers of our poet's period did not think proper
to study; but when Dryden's learning failed, his native stores
of fancy and numbers would have helped him through the task.</p>

<p>"The Character of the Good Priest" may be considered as an
<em>amende honorable</em> to the reverend order whom Dryden had often
satirized, and he himself seems to wish it to be viewed in that
light. See Preface, p. 225. With a freedom which he has frequently
employed elsewhere, Dryden has added the last forty lines, in
which, availing himself of the Revolution, which in Chaucer's time
placed Henry IV. on the throne, he represents the political principles
of his priest as the same with those of the non-juring clergy
of his own day. Indeed, the whole piece is greatly enlarged upon
Chaucer's sketch.</p>

  <span class="i0">An awful, reverend, and religious man.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His eyes diffused a venerable grace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And charity itself was in his face.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rich was his soul, though his attire was poor,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(As God had clothed his own ambassador;)</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Of sixty years he seemed, and well might last</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To sixty more, but that he lived too fast;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Refined himself to soul, to curb the sense,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made almost a sin of abstinence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet had his aspect nothing of severe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But such a face as promised him sincere;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nothing reserved or sullen was to see,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sweet regards, and pleasing sanctity;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mild was his accent, and his action free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With eloquence innate his tongue was armed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though harsh the precept, yet the preacher charmed.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">For, letting down the golden chain from high,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He drew his audience upward to the sky;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And oft, with holy hymns, he charmed their ears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A music more melodious than the spheres,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For David left him, when he went to rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His lyre; and after him he sung the best.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He bore his great commission in his look,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sweetly tempered awe, and softened all he spoke.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He preached the joys of heaven, and pains of hell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And warned the sinner with becoming zeal;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But on eternal mercy loved to dwell.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He taught the gospel rather than the law,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And forced himself to drive, but loved to draw.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For fear but freezes minds; but love, like heat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Exhales the soul sublime, to seek her native seat.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wrapped in his crimes, against the storm prepared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when the milder beams of mercy play,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He melts, and throws his cumbrous cloak away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lightnings and thunder, (heaven's artillery,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As harbingers before the Almighty fly:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Those but proclaim his style, and disappear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The stiller sound succeeds, and God is there.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The tithes, his parish freely paid, he took,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But never sued, or cursed with bell and book;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With patience bearing wrong, but offering none,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Since every man is free to lose his own.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The country churls, according to their kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Who grudge their dues, and love to be behind,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The less he sought his offerings, pinched the more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And praised a priest contented to be poor.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Yet of his little he had some to spare,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To feed the famished, and to clothe the bare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For mortified he was to that degree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A poorer than himself he would not see.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">True priests, he said, and preachers of the word,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Who, should they steal, for want of his relief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He judged himself accomplice with the thief.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Wide was his parish; not contracted close</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In streets, but here and there a straggling house;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet still he was at hand, without request,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To serve the sick, to succour the distressed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tempting on foot alone, without affright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dangers of a dark tempestuous night.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">All this, the good old man performed alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor spared his pains; for curate he had none.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor durst he trust another with his care;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor rode himself to Paul's, the public fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To chaffer for preferment with his gold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold;</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But duly watched his flock by night and day,</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And hungry sent the wily fox away.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The proud he tamed, the penitent he cheered;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor to rebuke the rich offender feared.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His preaching much, but more his practice wrought;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A living sermon of the truths he taught;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this by rules severe his life he squared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That all might see the doctrine which they heard.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For priests, he said, are patterns for the rest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(The gold of heaven, who bear the God impressed;)</span><br />

  <span class="i1">He went not, with the crowd, to see a shrine;</span><br />

  <span class="i1">In deference to his virtues, I forbear</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To shew you what the rest in orders were:</span><br />

<h3>SIGISMONDA AND GUISCARDO.</h3>


<p>This celebrated tale was probably taken by Boccacio from
some ancient chronicle or traditional legend. It excited great attention
among the learned of his time, and was translated into Latin
by Leonardo Aretino. Francesco di Michele Accolti de Arezzo,
who was accounted one of the best civilians of his age, rendered
into Italian verse the lamentation of Sigismonda over her lover's
heart; and the learned Philip Beroald made a Latin poetical
version of the whole fable. Translations and imitations without
number have been executed in foreign languages, without mentioning
the tragedies which have been founded upon it. In England,
the story was translated and versified in the octave stanza by
William Walter, a follower of Sir Henry Marney, chancellor of the
duchy of Lancaster.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> A prose translation is to be found in Painter's
"Palace of Pleasure;" and the tale being wrought into a
tragedy by Robert Wilmot and others, was presented before Queen
Elizabeth, at the Inner Temple, in 1568.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Dryden will not readily
be suspected of deriving much aid from his black-lettered predecessors.
He made Boccacio's story his own, and told it in his
own way. One gross fault he has engrafted upon his original; I
mean the coarseness of Sigismonda's character, whose love is that
of temperament, not of affection. This error, grounded upon Dryden's
false view of the passion and of the female character, and
perhaps arising from the depravity of the age rather than of the
poet, pervades and greatly injures the effect of the tale. Yet it
is more than counterbalanced by preponderating beauties. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
repeating the praise, elsewhere given to the majesty of the poet's
versification, and which this piece alone would be sufficient to justify,
the reader's attention may be solicited to the colours with
which Dryden has drawn a mind wrought up to the highest pitch
of despair. Sigismonda is placed in that situation, in which,
above all others, the human disposition seems to acquire a sort
of supernatural strength or obstinacy: for although guilty of a
crime, she is punished in a degree far exceeding the measure of
the offence. In such a situation, that acuteness of feeling, which
would otherwise waste itself in fluctuations betwixt shame, fear,
and remorse, is willingly and eagerly turned into the channel of
resistance and recrimination; and perhaps no readier mode can
be discovered of hardening the human heart, even to the consistence
of the nether millstone. It is in this state, that Sigismonda
resolutely, and even joyfully, embraces death, in order to punish
her father, and rejoin her lover. The previous arguments with
Tancred, sufficiently, and, in the circumstances, naturally, intimate
the tone of her mind, and are a striking instance of Dryden's
power in painting passion wrought up to desperation.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the middle ages, when the principality of Salerno
was ruled by a dynasty of Norman princes, deriving their
family from the celebrated Robert de Guiscard.</p>

GUISCARDO.</h3>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">W</span> <span class="smcap"> &nbsp; hile</span> Norman Tancred in Salerno reigned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The title of a gracious prince he gained;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till turned a tyrant in his latter days,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He lost the lustre of his former praise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, from the bright meridian where he stood</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Descending, dipped his hands in lovers' blood.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This prince, of fortune's favour long possessed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet was with one fair daughter only blessed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And blessed he might have been with her alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But oh! how much more happy had he none!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She was his care, his hope, and his delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Most in his thought, and ever in his sight:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Next, nay beyond his life, he held her dear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She lived by him, and now he lived in her.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this, when ripe for marriage, he delayed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her nuptial bands, and kept her long a maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As envying any else should share a part</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of what was his, and claiming all her heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length, as public decency required,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all his vassals eagerly desired,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">With mind averse, he rather underwent</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His people's will, than gave his own consent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So was she torn as from a lover's side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made, almost in his despite, a bride.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Short were her marriage-joys; for in the prime</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of youth, her lord expired before his time;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And to her father's court in little space</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Restored anew, she held a higher place;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More loved, and more exalted into grace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This princess, fresh and young, and fair and wise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The worshipped idol of her father's eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Did all her sex in every grace exceed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And had more wit beside than women need.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Youth, health, and ease, and most an amorous mind,&nbsp;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To second nuptials had her thoughts inclined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And former joys had left a secret sting behind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, prodigal in every other grant,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her sire left unsupplied her only want;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And she, betwixt her modesty and pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her wishes, which she could not help, would hide.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Resolved at last to lose no longer time,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And yet to please herself without a crime,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She cast her eyes around the court, to find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A worthy subject suiting to her mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To him in holy nuptials to be tied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A seeming widow, and a secret bride.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Among the train of courtiers, one she found</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With all the gifts of bounteous nature crowned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of gentle blood, but one whose niggard fate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had set him far below her high estate:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Guiscard his name was called, of blooming age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now squire to Tancred, and before his page:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To him, the choice of all the shining crowd,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her heart the noble Sigismonda vowed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Yet hitherto she kept her love concealed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And with close glances every day beheld</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The graceful youth; and every day increased</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The raging fire that burned within her breast:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some secret charm did all his acts attend,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And what his fortune wanted, hers could mend;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till, as the fire will force its outward way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or, in the prison pent, consume the prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So long her earnest eyes on his were set,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length their twisted rays together met;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And he, surprised with humble joy, surveyed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One sweet regard, shot by the royal maid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not well assured, while doubtful hopes he nursed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A second glance came gliding like the first;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And he, who saw the sharpness of the dart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Without defence received it in his heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In public, though their passion wanted speech,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet mutual looks interpreted for each:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Time, ways, and means of meeting, were denied;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all those wants ingenious love supplied.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The inventive God, who never fails his part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Inspires the wit, when once he warms the heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">When Guiscard next was in the circle seen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where Sigismonda held the place of queen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A hollow cane within her hand she brought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in the concave had inclosed a note;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With this she seemed to play, and, as in sport,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tossed to her love, in presence of the court:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Take it, she said; and when your needs require,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This little brand will serve to light your fire.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He took it with a bow, and soon divined</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The seeming toy was not for nought designed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But when retired, so long with curious eyes</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He viewed the present, that he found the prize.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Much was in little writ; and all conveyed</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With cautious care, for fear to be betrayed</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By some false confident, or favourite maid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The time, the place, the manner how to meet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were all in punctual order plainly writ:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But since a trust must be, she thought it best</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To put it out of laymen's power at least,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And for their solemn vows prepared a priest.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Guiscard (her secret purpose understood)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With joy prepared to meet the coming good;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor pains nor danger was resolved to spare,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But use the means appointed by the fair.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Near the proud palace of Salerno stood</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A mount of rough ascent, and thick with wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Through this a cave was dug with vast expence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The work it seemed of some suspicious prince,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, when abusing power with lawless might,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From public justice would secure his flight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The passage made by many a winding way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reached even the room in which the tyrant lay.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fit for his purpose, on a lower floor</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He lodged, whose issue was an iron door;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From whence, by stairs descending to the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In the blind grot a safe retreat he found.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Its outlet ended in a brake o'ergrown</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With brambles, choked by time, and now unknown.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A rift there was, which from the mountain's height</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Conveyed a glimmering and malignant light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A breathing place to draw the damps away,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A twilight of an intercepted day.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tyrant's den, whose use, though lost to fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was now the apartment of the royal dame;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The cavern, only to her father known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By him was to his darling daughter shewn.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Neglected long she let the secret rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till love recalled it to her labouring breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And hinted as the way by heaven designed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The teacher, by the means he taught, to blind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What will not women do, when need inspires</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Their wit, or love their inclination fires!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though jealousy of state the invention found,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet love refined upon the former ground.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">That way, the tyrant had reserved to fly</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pursuing hate, now served to bring two lovers nigh.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dame, who long in vain had kept the key,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Bold by desire, explored the secret way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now tried the stairs, and wading through the night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Searched all the deep recess, and issued into light.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">All this her letter had so well explained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The instructed youth might compass what remained;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The cavern mouth alone was hard to find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because the path, disused, was out of mind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in what quarter of the copse it lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His eye by certain level could survey:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet (for the wood perplexed with thorns he knew)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A frock of leather o'er his limbs he drew;<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, thus provided, searched the brake around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till the choked entry of the cave he found.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus, all prepared, the promised hour arrived,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So long expected, and so well contrived:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With love to friend, the impatient lover went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fenced from the thorns, and trod the deep descent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The conscious priest, who was suborned before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stood ready posted at the postern door;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The maids in distant rooms were sent to rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And nothing wanted but the invited guest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He came, and, knocking thrice without delay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The longing lady heard, and turned the key;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At once invaded him with all her charms,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the first step he made was in her arms:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The leathern outside, boisterous as it was,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Gave way, and bent beneath her strict embrace:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">On either side the kisses flew so thick,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That neither he nor she had breath to speak.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The holy man, amazed at what he saw,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made haste to sanctify the bliss by law;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And muttered fast the matrimony o'er,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For fear committed sin should get before.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His work performed, he left the pair alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because he knew he could not go too soon;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His presence odious, when his task was done.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What thoughts he had beseems not me to say;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though some surmise he went to fast and pray,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And needed both to drive the tempting thoughts away.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The foe once gone, they took their full delight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas restless rage, and tempest all the night;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For greedy love each moment would employ,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And grudged the shortest pauses of their joy.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus were their loves auspiciously begun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thus with secret care were carried on.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The stealth itself did appetite restore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And looked so like a sin, it pleased the more.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The cave was now become a common way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wicket, often opened, knew the key:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love rioted secure, and, long enjoyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was ever eager, and was never cloyed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But as extremes are short, of ill and good,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And tides at highest mark regorge the flood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So fate, that could no more improve their joy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Took a malicious pleasure to destroy.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Tancred, who fondly loved, and whose delight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was placed in his fair daughter's daily sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of custom, when his state affairs were done,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Would pass his pleasing hours with her alone;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as a father's privilege allowed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Without attendance of the officious crowd.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">It happened once, that when in heat of day</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He tried to sleep, as was his usual way,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The balmy slumber fled his wakeful eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And forced him, in his own despite, to rise:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of sleep forsaken, to relieve his care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He sought the conversation of the fair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But with her train of damsels she was gone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In shady walks the scorching heat to shun:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would not violate that sweet recess,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And found besides a welcome heaviness,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That seized his eyes; and slumber, which forgot</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When called before to come, now came unsought.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From light retired, behind his daughter's bed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He for approaching sleep composed his head;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A chair was ready, for that use designed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So quilted, that he lay at ease reclined;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The curtains closely drawn, the light to skreen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if he had contrived to lie unseen:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus covered with an artificial night,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sleep did his office soon, and sealed his sight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">With heaven averse in this ill-omened hour,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was Guiscard summoned to the secret bower,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the fair nymph, with expectation fired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From her attending damsels was retired:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, true to love, she measured time so right,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As not to miss one moment of delight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The garden, seated on the level floor,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She left behind, and locking every door,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thought all secure; but little did she know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Blind to her fate, she had inclosed her foe.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Attending Guiscard, in his leathern frock,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stood ready, with his thrice-repeated knock:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thrice with a doleful sound the jarring grate</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rung deaf and hollow, and presaged their fate.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The door unlocked, to known delight they haste,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, panting in each other's arms, embraced;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rush to the conscious bed, a mutual freight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And heedless press it with their wonted weight.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And heedless press it with their wonted weight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The sudden bound awaked the sleeping sire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And shewed a sight no parent can desire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His opening eyes at once with odious view</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The love discovered, and the lover knew:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would have cried; but hoping that he dreamt,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Amazement tied his tongue, and stopped the attempt.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ensuing moment all the truth declared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But now he stood collected, and prepared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For malice and revenge had put him on his guard.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So like a lion that unheeded lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dissembling sleep, and watchful to betray,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With inward rage he meditates his prey.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The thoughtless pair, indulging their desires,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alternate kindled, and then quenched their fires;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor thinking in the shades of death they played,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Full of themselves, themselves alone surveyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, too secure, were by themselves betrayed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long time dissolved in pleasure thus they lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till nature could no more suffice their play;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then rose the youth, and, through the cave again</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Returned, the princess mingled with her train.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Resolved his unripe vengeance to defer,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The royal spy, when now the coast was clear,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sought not the garden, but retired unseen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To brood in secret on his gathered spleen,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And methodize revenge: to death he grieved;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, but he saw the crime, had scarce believed.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appointment for the ensuing night he heard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And therefore in the cavern had prepared</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two brawny yeomen of his trusty guard.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Scarce had unwary Guiscard set his foot</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Within the foremost entrance of the grot,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When these in secret ambush ready lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And rushing on the sudden seized the prey:</span><br />

  <span class="i0">The heroine assumed the woman's place,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Resolved on fate, she would not lose her breath,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Fixed on this thought, she, not as women use,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her fault by common frailty would excuse;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But boldly justified her innocence,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Then with dry eyes, and with an open look,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She met his glance mid-way, and thus undaunted spoke:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Tancred, I neither am disposed to make</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Request for life, nor offered life to take;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Much less deny the deed; but least of all</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beneath pretended justice weakly fall.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My words to sacred truth shall be confined,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">That I have loved, I own; that still I love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I call to witness all the powers above:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet more I own; to Guiscard's love I give</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The small remaining time I have to live;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And if beyond this life desire can be,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not fate itself shall set my passion free.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This first avowed; nor folly warped my mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor the frail texture of the female kind</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betrayed my virtue; for, too well I knew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What honour was, and honour had his due:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before the holy priest my vows were tied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So came I not a strumpet, but a bride.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This for my fame, and for the public voice;</span><br />

<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My tender age in luxury was trained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With idle ease and pageants entertained;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My hours my own, my pleasures unrestrained.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">For when the father is too fondly kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such seed he sows, such harvest shall he find.</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Warmed with more particles of heavenly flame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He winged his upward flight, and soared to fame;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">But true nobility is of the mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not given by chance, and not to chance resigned.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">For the remaining doubt of thy decree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What to resolve, and how dispose of me;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Be warned to cast that useless care aside,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Myself alone will for myself provide.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If in thy doating and decrepit age,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thy soul, a stranger in thy youth to rage,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Begins in cruel deeds to take delight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Gorge with my blood thy barbarous appetite;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For I so little am disposed to pray</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For life, I would not cast a wish away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as it is, the offence is all my own;</span><br />

  <span class="i1">She said; nor did her father fail to find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In all she spoke, the greatness of her mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet thought she was not obstinate to die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor deemed the death she promised was so nigh.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Secure in this belief, he left the dame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Resolved to spare her life, and save her shame;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But that detested object to remove,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">A mute revenge, and blind as was the crime.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His faithful heart, a bloody sacrifice,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Torn from his breast, to glut the tyrant's eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Closed the severe command; for (slaves to pay)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What kings decree, the soldier must obey:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Waged against foes; and when the wars are o'er,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fit only to maintain despotic power;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Dangerous to freedom, and desired alone</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Such were these guards; as ready to have slain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The prince himself, allured with greater gain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So was the charge performed with better will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By men inured to blood, and exercised in ill.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now, though the sullen sire had eased his mind,&nbsp;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The pomp of his revenge was yet behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A pomp prepared to grace the present he designed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A goblet rich with gems, and rough with gold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of depth and breadth the precious pledge to hold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With cruel care he chose; the hollow part</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Inclosed, the lid concealed the lover's heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then of his trusted mischiefs one he sent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And bade him, with these words, the gift present:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">"Thy father sends thee this to cheer thy breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And glad thy sight with what thou lov'st the best;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As thou hast pleased his eyes, and joyed his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With what he loved the most of human kind."&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Ere this, the royal dame, who well had weighed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The consequence of what her sire had said,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fixed on her fate, against the expected hour,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">procured the means to have it in her power;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">For this, she had distilled, with early care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The juice of simples, friendly to despair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A magazine of death; and thus prepared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Secure to die, the fatal message heard:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then smiled severe; nor with a troubled look,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or trembling hand, the funeral present took;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even kept her countenance, when the lid removed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Disclosed the heart, unfortunately loved.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She needed not be told, within whose breast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It lodged; the message had explained the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or not amazed, or hiding her surprise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She sternly on the bearer fixed her eyes;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then thus:&mdash;Tell Tancred, on his daughter's part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The gold, though precious, equals not the heart:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But he did well to give his best; and I,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who wished a worthier urn, forgive his poverty.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At this she curbed a groan, that else had come,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, pausing, viewed the present in the tomb;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then to the heart, adored devoutly, glued</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her lips, and, raising it, her speech renewed:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even from my day of birth to this, the bound</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of my unhappy being, I have found</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My father's care and tenderness expressed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But this last act of love excels the rest:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For this so dear a present, bear him back</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The best return that I can live to make.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The messenger dispatched, again she viewed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The loved remains, and, sighing, thus pursued:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Source of my life, and lord of my desires,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In whom I lived, with whom my soul expires!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Poor heart! no more the spring of vital heat;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And thou from thy corporeal prison freed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Soon hast thou reached the goal with mended pace;</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To better uses than his hate designed;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And save myself the pains to weep below,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If souls can weep. Though once I meant to meet</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My fate with face unmoved, and eyes unwet,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet, since I have thee here in narrow room,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My tears shall set thee first afloat within thy tomb.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then (as I know thy spirit hovers nigh)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Under thy friendly conduct will I fly</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To regions unexplored, secure to share</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And heaven is double heaven, if thou art there.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">She said: Her brimful eyes, that ready stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And only wanted will to weep a flood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Released their watery store, and poured amain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like clouds low-hung, a sober shower of rain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mute solemn sorrow, free from female noise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Such as the majesty of grief destroys;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For, bending o'er the cup, the tears she shed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seemed by the posture to discharge her head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">O'er-filled before; and (oft her mouth applied</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To the cold heart) she kissed at once, and cried.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her maids, who stood amazed, nor knew the cause</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of her complaining, nor whose heart it was,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet all due measures of her mourning kept,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Did office at the dirge, and by infection wept,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">And oft enquired the occasion of her grief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Unanswered but by sighs) and offered vain relief.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At length, her stock of tears already shed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She wiped her eyes, she raised her drooping head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thus pursued:&mdash;O ever faithful heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I have performed the ceremonial part,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The decencies of grief; it rests behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, as our bodies were, our souls be joined;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To thy whate'er abode my shade convey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, as an elder ghost, direct the way!&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She said; and bade the vial to be brought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where she before had brewed the deadly draught;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">First pouring out the med'cinable bane,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The heart, her tears had rinsed, she bathed again;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then down her throat the death securely throws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And quaffs a long oblivion of her woes.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This done, she mounts the genial bed, and there</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Her body first composed with honest care)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Attends the welcome rest; her hands yet hold,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Close to her heart, the monumental gold;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor farther word she spoke, but closed her sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And quiet sought the covert of the night.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The damsels, who the while in silence mourned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not knowing, nor suspecting death suborned,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet, as their duty was, to Tancred sent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, conscious of the occasion, feared the event.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alarmed, and with presaging heart, he came,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And drew the curtains, and exposed the dame</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To loathsome light; then, with a late relief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made vain efforts to mitigate her grief.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She, what she could, excluding day, her eyes</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Kept firmly sealed, and sternly thus replies:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Tancred, restrain thy tears, unsought by me,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sorrow unavailing now to thee:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Did ever man before afflict his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To see the effect of what himself designed?</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Yet if thou hast remaining in thy heart</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some sense of love, some unextinguished part</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of former kindness, largely once professed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let me by that adjure thy hardened breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not to deny thy daughter's last request:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret love which I so long enjoyed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And still concealed, to gratify thy pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou hast disjoined; but, with my dying breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seek not, I beg thee, to disjoin our death:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where'er his corpse by thy command is laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thither let mine in public be conveyed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Exposed in open view, and side by side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Acknowledged as a bridegroom and a bride.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The prince's anguish hindered his reply;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And she, who felt her fate approaching nigh,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seized the cold heart, and heaving to her breast,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Here, precious pledge, she said, securely rest.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">These accents were her last; the creeping death</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Benumbed her senses first, then stopped her breath.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus she for disobedience justly died;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The sire was justly punished for his pride;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The youth, least guilty, suffered for the offence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of duty violated to his prince;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who, late repenting of his cruel deed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One common sepulchre for both decreed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Entombed the wretched pair in royal state,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And on their monument inscribed their fate.</span><br />

<h3>ORIGINAL, FROM THE DECAMERON.</h3>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="p3">THE FOURTH DAY.</p>

<p class="p1">NOVEL I.</p>


<blockquote><p><em>Tancred, prince of Salerno, puts his daughter's lover to death, and
sends his heart to her in a golden cup; she pours water upon it,
which she had poisoned, and so dies.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Our king has given us a most melancholy subject for this day's
discourse; considering that, as we came hither to be merry, we
must now recount other people's misfortunes, which cannot be related
without moving compassion, as well in those who tell, as in
those who hear them. Perhaps it is designed as an allay to the
mirth of the preceding days. But, whatever his reason may be
for it, I have no business to make any alteration with regard to
his pleasure. I shall, therefore, mention an unhappy story to you,
worthy of your most tender compassion.</p>

<p>Tancred, prince of Salerno, was a most humane and generous
lord, had he not, in his old age, defiled his hands in a lover's blood.
He, through the whole course of his life, had one only daughter;
and happy had he been not to have possessed her. No child could
be more dear to a parent than she was, which made him loth to
part with her in marriage: at length, not till she was a little advanced
in years, he married her to the duke of Capoa, when she
was soon left a widow, and came home again to her father. She
was a lady of great beauty and understanding, and continuing thus
in the court of her father, who took no care to marry her again,
and it seeming not so modest in her to ask it, she resolved at last
to have a lover privately. Accordingly, she made choice of a
person of low parentage, but noble qualities, whose name was Guiscard,
with whom she became violently in love; and by often seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
him, and evermore commending his manner and behaviour, he
soon became sensible of it, and devoted himself entirely to the
love of her. Affecting each other thus in secret, and she desiring
nothing so much as to be with him, and not daring to trust any
person with the affair, contrived a new stratagem in order to apprise
him of the means. She wrote a letter, wherein she mentioned
what she would have him do the next day for her; this she put
into a hollow cane, and giving it to him one day, she said, pleasantly,
"You may make a pair of bellows of this, for your servant
to blow the fire with this evening." He received it, supposing,
very justly, that it had some meaning, and, taking it home, found
the letter; which, when he had thoroughly considered, and knew
what he had to do, he was the most overjoyed man that could be;
and he applied himself accordingly to answer her assignation, in
the manner she had directed him. On one side of the palace, and
under a mountain, was a grotto, which had been made time out
of mind, and into which no light could come but through a little
opening dug in the mountain, and which, as the grotto had been
long in disuse, was now grown over with briers and thorns. Into
this grotto was a passage, by a private stair-case, out of one of the
rooms of the palace, which belonged to the lady's apartment, and
was secured by a very strong door. This passage was so far out
of every one's thoughts, having been disused for so long a time,
that nobody remembered any thing about it; but love, whose notice
nothing can escape, brought it fresh into the mind of the enamoured
lady; who, to keep this thing entirely private, laboured
some days before she could get the door open; when having gone
down into the cave, and observed the opening, and how high it
might be from thence to the bottom, she acquainted him with the
fact. Guiscard then provided a ladder of cords; and casing himself
well with leather, to be defended from the thorns, fixing one
end of the ladder to the stump of a tree which was near, he slid
down by the help of it to the bottom, where he stayed expecting
the lady. The following day, therefore, having sent her maids
out of the way, under pretence that she was going to lie down,
and locking herself up alone in her chamber, she opened the door,
and descended into the grotto, where they met to their mutual satisfaction.
From thence she shewed him the way to her chamber,
where they were together the greatest part of the day, and
taking proper measures for the time to come, he went away through
the cave, and she returned to her maids. The same he did the
next night; and he followed this course for a considerable time,
when fortune, as if she envied them their happiness, thought fit to
change their mirth into mourning. Tancred used sometimes to
come into his daughter's chamber, to pass a little time away with
her; and going thither one day after dinner, whilst the lady, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
name was Ghismond, was with her maids in the garden; and being
perceived by no one, nor yet willing to take her from her diversion,
finding also the windows shut, and the curtains drawn to
the feet of the bed, he threw himself down in a great chair, which
stood in a corner of the room, leaning his head upon the bed, and
drawing the curtain before him, as if he concealed himself on purpose,
when he chanced to fall asleep. In the mean time, Ghismond
having made an appointment with her lover, left the maids
in the garden, and came into her chamber, which she secured, not
thinking of any person being there, and went to meet Guiscard,
who was in the cave waiting for her, and brought him into her
chamber; when her father awoke, and was a witness to all that
passed between them. This was the utmost affliction to him, and
he was about to cry out; but, upon second thoughts, he resolved
to keep it private, if possible, that he might be able to do more securely,
and with less disgrace, what he had resolved upon. The
lovers stayed together their usual time, without perceiving any
thing of Tancred, who, after they were departed, got out of the
window into the garden, old as he was, and went, without being
seen by any one, very sorrowful to his chamber. The next night,
according to his orders, Guiscard was seized by two men as he was
coming out of the cave, and carried by them, in his leathern doublet,
to Tancred, who, as soon as he saw him, said, with tears in
his eyes: "Guiscard, you have ill requited my kindness towards
you, by this outrage and shame which you have brought upon
me, and of which this very day I have been an eye-witness."
When he made no other answer but this: "Sir, love hath greater
power than either you or I." Tancred then ordered a guard to
be set over him. And the next day he went to his daughter's
apartment as usual, she knowing nothing of what had happened,
and shutting the door, that they might be private together, he said
to her, weeping, "Daughter, I had such an opinion of your modesty
and virtue, that I could never have believed, had I not seen
it with my own eyes, that you would have violated either, even
so much as in thought. My reflecting on this will make the small
pittance of life that is left very grievous to me. As you were determined
to act in that manner, would to heaven you had made
choice of a person more suitable to your own quality; but for
this Guiscard, he is one of the very meanest persons about my
court. This gives me such concern, that I scarcely know what to
do. As for him, he was secured by my order last night, and his
fate is determined. But, with regard to yourself, I am influenced
by two different motives; on one side, the tenderest regard that a
father can have for a child; and on the other, the justest vengeance
for the great folly you have committed. One pleads strongly
in your behalf; and the other would excite me to do an act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
contrary to my nature. But before I come to a resolution, I
would hear what you have to say for yourself." And when he
said this, he hung down his head, and wept like a child. She
hearing this from her father, and perceiving that their amour was
not only discovered, but her lover in prison, was under the greatest
concern imaginable, and was going to break out into loud and
grievous lamentations, as is the way of women in distress; but
getting the better of this weakness, and putting on a settled countenance,
as supposing Guiscard was dead, and being resolved firmly
in her own mind not to outlive him, she spoke therefore with
all the composure in the world to this purpose: "Sir, to deny
what I have done, or to entreat any favour of you, is no part of
my design at present; for as the one can avail me nothing, so I
intend the other shall be of little service. I will take no advantage
of your love and tenderness towards me; but shall first, by
an open confession, endeavour to vindicate myself, and then do
what the greatness of my soul prompts me to. 'Tis most true that
I have loved, and do still love, Guiscard; and while I live, which
will not be long, shall continue to love him: and if such a thing
as love be after death, even that shall not dissolve it. To this I
was induced by no frailty, so much as his superior virtue, and the
little care you took to marry me again. I preferred him before
all the world; and as to the meanness of his station, to which you
so much object, that is more the fault of fortune, who often raises
the most unworthy to an high estate, neglecting those of greater
merit. We are all formed of the same materials, and by the same
hand. The first difference amongst mankind was made by virtue;
they who were virtuous were deemed noble, and the rest were all
accounted otherwise. Though this law therefore may have been
obscured by contrary custom, yet is it discarded neither by nature,
nor good manners. If you then alone regard the worth and
virtue of your courtiers, and consider that of Guiscard, you will
find him the only noble person, and the others a set of poltroons.
With regard to his worth and valour, I appeal to yourself. Who
ever commended man more for every thing that was praise-worthy,
than you have commended him? and deservedly in my judgement;
but if I was deceived, it was by following your opinion.
If you say then, that I have had an affair with a person base and
ignoble, I deny it; if with a poor one, it is to your shame, to let
such merit go unrewarded. Now concerning your last doubt,
namely, how you are to deal with me; use your pleasure. If
you are disposed to commit an act of cruelty, I shall say nothing
to prevent such a resolution. But this I must apprise you of, that
unless you do the same to me, which you either have done, or
mean to do to Guiscard, my own hands shall do it for you. Reserve
your tears then for women; and if you mean to act with severity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
cut us off both together, if it appears to you that we have
deserved it." The prince knew full well the greatness of her soul;
but yet he could by no means persuade himself, that she would
have resolution enough to do what her words seemed to threaten.
Leaving her then, with a design of being favourable to her, and
intending to wean her affection from her lover by taking him off,
he gave orders to the two men, who guarded him, to strangle him
privately in the night, and to take his heart out of his body, and
bring it to him. Accordingly they executed his commands, and
the next day he called for a golden cup, and putting the heart
into it, he had it conveyed by a trusty servant to his daughter,
with this message: "Your father sends this present to comfort
you, with what was most dear to you; even as he was comforted
by you, in what was most dear to him." She had departed from
her father, not at all moved as to her resolution, and therefore had
prepared the juices of some poisonous plants, which she had mixed
with water to be at hand, if what she feared should come to pass.
When the servant had delivered the present, and reported the message
according to his order, she took the cup, without changing
countenance, and seeing the heart therein, and knowing by the
words that it must be Guiscard's, she looked stedfastly at the servant,
and said: "My father has done very wisely; such a heart
as this requires no worse a sepulchre than that of gold." And
upon this she lifted it to her mouth and kissed it, thus continuing;
"All my life long, even to this last period of it, have I found my
father's love most abundant towards me; but now more than
ever: therefore return him, in my name, the last thanks that I
shall ever be able to give him for such a present." Looking then
towards the cup, which she held fast in her hand, she said: "Alas!
the dearest end and centre of all my wishes! Cursed be the cruelty
of him, by whom these eyes now see you; although my soul
had long viewed and known you. You have finished your course;
such a one indeed as fortune has thought fit to allot you; you
are arrived at the goal to which we all tend; you have left the
miseries of this world far behind, and have obtained such a sepulchre
from your very enemy, as your merit required. Nothing
remained to make your obsequies complete, but the tears of her
who was so dear to you whilst you were living; and which, that
you should not now want, heaven put it into the mind of my relentless
father to send you to me. And you shall have them,
though I had purposed to die unmoved, and without shedding a
tear; and when I have done, I will instantly join my soul to
yours: for in what other company can I go better and safer to
those unknown regions? as I make no doubt your soul is hovering
here, expecting mine." When she had done speaking, she
shed a flood of tears, kissing the heart a thousand times; whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
the damsels who were about her knew neither what heart it was,
nor what those her words imported; but being moved with pity,
they joined with her, begging to know the cause of her grief, and
endeavouring all they could to comfort her. After she had lamented
as much as she thought proper, she raised up her head,
and wiping her eyes, said, "Thou heart, most dearly beloved!
all my duty is now performed towards thee; nothing more remains,
but for my soul to accompany thine." Upon this she bade
them reach the vessel of water, which she had prepared the day
before, and pouring it into the cup with the heart, which she had
sufficiently washed with her tears, she drank it all off without the
least dread or apprehension; and then threw herself upon the bed
with the cup in her hand, composing her body as decently as she
could, and pressing her lover's heart to her's, she lay without uttering
a word more, expecting death. The maids, when they saw
this, though they knew not what it was she had drunk, sent to acquaint
Tancred; who fearing what had really happened, came
into the room soon after she had laid herself down, and finding it
was too late, began to lament most grievously. She then said to
him, "Sir, save those tears against worse fortune that may happen,
for I want them not. Who but yourself would mourn for a
thing of your own doing? But if any part of that love now remains
in you, which you once had for me, the last request I shall
make is, that as you would not suffer us to be happy together
whilst living, that our two bodies (wherever you have disposed of
his) may be publicly interred together when dead." Extreme
grief would suffer him to make no reply; when, finding herself
drawing near her end, she strained the heart strongly to her
breast, saying, "Receive us, heaven; I die!" Then closing her
eyes, all sense forsook her, and she departed this miserable life.
Such an end had the amours of Guiscard and Ghismond, as you
have now heard; whilst the prince, repenting of his cruelty when
it was too late, had them buried in one grave, in the most public
manner, to the general grief of all the people of Salerno.</p>

<h3>THEODORE AND HONORIA.</h3>


<p>Boccacio, who, according to Benvenuto da Imola, was a curious
investigator of all delectable histories, is said to have taken
this goblin tale from the Chronicle of Helinandus, a French
monk, who flourished in the reign of Philip Augustus,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and composed
a history of the world from its creation, as was the fashion
of monkish historians. The Florentine novelist, however, altered
the place of action, and disguised the names of the persons,
whom he calls Nastagio and Traversari, the designations of two
noble families in Ravenna. So good a subject for a ballad did
not escape our English makers, by one of whom the novel of Boccacio
was turned into the ballad stanza<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>. Dryden, however, converted
that into a poem, which, in the hands of the old rhymer, was
only a tale, and has given us a proof how exquisitely his powers
were adapted for the management of the machinery, or supernatural
agency of an epic poem, had his situation suffered him to undertake
the task he so long meditated. Nothing can be more highly
painted than the circumstances preliminary of the apparition;&mdash;
the deepening gloom, the falling wind, the commencement of
an earthquake; above all, the indescribable sensation of horror
with which Theodore is affected, even ere he sees the actors in the
supernatural tragedy. The appearance of the female, of the gaunt
mastiffs by which she is pursued, and of the infernal huntsman, are
all in the highest tone of poetry, and could only be imitated by
the pencil of Salvator. There is also a masterly description of
Theodore's struggles between his native courage, prompted by chivalrous
education, and that terror which the presence of supernatural
beings imposes upon the living. It is by the account of the
impression, which such a sight makes upon the supposed spectator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
more even than by a laboured description of the vision itself,
that the narrator of such a tale must hope to excite the sympathetic
awe of his audience. Thus, in the vision so sublimely described
in the book of Job, chap. iv. no external cause of terror
is even sketched in outline, and our feelings of dread are only excited
by the fear which came upon the spectator, and the trembling
which made all his bones to shake. But the fable of Dryden
combines a most impressive description of the vision, with a
detailed account of its effect upon Theodore, and both united
make the most admirable poem of the kind that ever was written.
It is somewhat derogatory from the dignity of the apparition, that
Theodore, having once witnessed its terrors, should coolly lay a
scheme for converting them to his own advantage; but this is an
original fault in the story, for which Dryden is not answerable.
The second apparition of the infernal hunter to the assembled
guests, is as striking as the first; a circumstance well worthy of
notice, when we consider the difficulty and hazard of telling such
a story twice. But in the second narration, the poet artfully hurries
over the particulars of the lady's punishment, which were formerly
given in detail, and turns the reader's attention upon the novel
effect produced by it, upon the assembled guests, which is admirably
described, as "a mute scene of sorrow mixed with fear." The interrupted
banquet, the appalled gallants, and the terrified women, grouped
with the felon knight, his meagre mastiffs, and mangled victim,
displays the hand of the master poet. The conclusion of the story
is defective from the cause already hinted at. The machinery is
too powerful for the effect produced by it; a lady's hard heart
might have been melted without so terrible an example of the
punishment of obduracy.</p>

<p>It is scarcely worth while to mention, that Dryden has changed
the Italian names into others better adapted to English heroic
verse.</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0"><span class="dropcap">O</span> <span class="smcap"> &nbsp;f</span> all the cities in Romanian lands,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The chief, and most renowned, Ravenna stands;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Adorned in ancient times with arms and arts,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And rich inhabitants, with generous hearts.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But Theodore the brave, above the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With gifts of fortune and of nature blessed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The foremost place for wealth and honour held,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all in feats of chivalry excelled.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This noble youth to madness loved a dame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of high degree, Honoria was her name;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fair as the fairest, but of haughty mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And fiercer than became so soft a kind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proud of her birth, (for equal she had none;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rest she scorned, but hated him alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His gifts, his constant courtship, nothing gained;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For she, the more he loved, the more disdained.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He lived with all the pomp he could devise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At tilts and tournaments obtained the prize,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But found no favour in his lady's eyes:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Relentless as a rock, the lofty maid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Turned all to poison that he did or said:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor prayers, nor tears, nor offered vows, could move.</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The work went backward; and the more he strove</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To advance his suit, the farther from her love.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Wearied at length, and wanting remedy,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He doubted oft, and oft resolved to die.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But pride stood ready to prevent the blow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For who would die to gratify a foe?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His generous mind disdained so mean a fate;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That passed, his next endeavour was to hate.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But vainer that relief than all the rest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The less he hoped, with more desire possessed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Love stood the siege, and would not yield his breast.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Change was the next, but change deceived his care;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He sought a fairer, but found none so fair.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He would have worn her out by slow degrees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As men by fasting starve the untamed disease;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But present love required a present ease.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Looking, he feeds alone his famished eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Feeds lingering death; but, looking not, he dies.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet still he chose the longest way to fate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Wasting at once his life, and his estate.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His friends beheld, and pitied him in vain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For what advice can ease a lover's pain!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Absence, the best expedient they could find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Might save the fortune, if not cure the mind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This means they long proposed, but little gained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet after much pursuit, at length obtained.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Hard you may think it was to give consent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, struggling with his own desires, he went;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With large expence, and with a pompous train,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Provided as to visit France or Spain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or for some distant voyage o'er the main.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But love had clipped his wings, and cut him short,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Confined within the purlieus of his court.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Three miles he went, nor farther could retreat;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His travels ended at his country-seat:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To Chassis' pleasing plains he took his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There pitched his tents, and there resolved to stay.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The spring was in the prime; the neighbouring grove</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Supplied by birds, the choristers of love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Music unbought, that ministered delight</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To morning walks, and lulled his cares by night:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There he discharged his friends; but not the expence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of frequent treats, and proud magnificence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He lived as kings retire, though more at large</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From public business, yet with equal charge;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With house and heart still open to receive;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As well content as love would give him leave:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would have lived more free; but many a guest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Who could forsake the friend, pursued the feast.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">It happ'd one morning, as his fancy led,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Before his usual hour he left his bed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To walk within a lonely lawn, that stood</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On every side surrounded by the wood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Alone he walked, to please his pensive mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And sought the deepest solitude to find:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Twas in a grove of spreading pines he strayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The winds within the quivering branches played,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And dancing trees a mournful music made.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The place itself was suiting to his care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Uncouth and savage, as the cruel fair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He wandered on, unknowing where he went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Lost in the wood, and all on love intent:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The day already half his race had run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And summoned him to due repast at noon,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But love could feel no hunger but his own.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">While listening to the murmuring leaves he stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More than a mile immersed within the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At once the wind was laid; the whispering sound</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was dumb; a rising earthquake rocked the ground;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Was dumb; a rising earthquake rocked the ground;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With deeper brown the grove was overspread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A sudden horror seized his giddy head,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And his ears tinkled, and his colour fled.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nature was in alarm; some danger nigh</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seemed threatened, though unseen to mortal eye.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unused to fear, he summoned all his soul,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And stood collected in himself, and whole:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not long; for soon a whirlwind rose around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from afar he heard a screaming sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As of a dame distressed, who cried for aid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And filled with loud laments the secret shade.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">A thicket close beside the grove there stood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With briers and brambles choked, and dwarfish wood:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From thence the noise, which now approaching near,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With more distinguished notes invades his ear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He raised his head, and saw a beauteous maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With hair dishevelled, issuing through the shade;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stripped of her clothes, and even those parts revealed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which modest nature keeps from sight concealed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her face, her hands, her naked limbs, were torn,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With passing through the brakes and prickly thorn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Two mastiffs gaunt and grim her flight pursued,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And oft their fastened fangs in blood embrued:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Oft they came up, and pinched her tender side,&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mercy, O mercy! heaven, she ran, and cried;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When heaven was named, they loosed their hold again;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then sprung she forth, they followed her amain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Not far behind, a knight of swarthy face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">High on a coal-black steed pursued the chace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With flashing flames his ardent eyes were filled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in his hand a naked sword he held:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He cheered the dogs to follow her who fled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And vowed revenge on her devoted head.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">As Theodore was born of noble kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The brutal action roused his manly mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Moved with th' unworthy usage of the maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He, though unarmed, resolved to give her aid.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">A saplin pine he wrenched from out the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The readiest weapon that his fury found.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus furnished for offence, he crossed the way</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betwixt the graceless villain and his prey.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The knight came thundering on, but, from afar,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus in imperious tone forbade the war:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cease, Theodore, to proffer vain relief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor stop the vengeance of so just a grief;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But give me leave to seize my destined prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And let eternal justice take the way:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I but revenge my fate, disdained, betrayed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And suffering death for this ungrateful maid.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">He said, at once dismounting from the steed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For now the hell-hounds with superior speed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had reached the dame, and fastening on her side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ground with issuing streams of purple dyed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stood Theodore surprised in deadly fright,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With chattering teeth, and bristling hair upright;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet armed with inborn worth,&mdash;Whate'er, said he,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thou art, who know'st me better than I thee,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or prove thy rightful cause, or be defied.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The spectre, fiercely staring, thus replied:</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Know, Theodore, thy ancestry I claim,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Guido Cavalcanti was my name.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">One common sire our fathers did beget,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My name and story some remember yet:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thee, then a boy, within my arms I laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When for my sins I loved this haughty maid;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not less adored in life, nor served by me,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than proud Honoria now is loved by thee.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What did I not, her stubborn heart to gain?</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But all my vows were answered with disdain;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She scorned my sorrows, and despised my pain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long time I dragged my days in fruitless care;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then loathing life, and plunged in deep despair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To finish my unhappy life, I fell</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On this sharp sword, and now am damned in hell.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Short was her joy; for soon the insulting maid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By heaven's decree in the cold grave was laid;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as in unrepented sin she died,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Doomed to the same bad place, is punished for her pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Because she deemed I well deserved to die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made a merit of her cruelty.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">There, then, we met; both tried, and both were cast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And this irrevocable sentence passed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That she, whom I so long pursued in vain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Should suffer from my hands a lingering pain:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Renewed to life, that she might daily die,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I daily doomed to follow, she to fly;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No more a lover, but a mortal foe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I seek her life (for love is none below;)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As often as my dogs with better speed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Arrest her flight, is she to death decreed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then with this fatal sword, on which I died,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">I pierce her open back, or tender side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And tear that hardened heart from out her breast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which, with her entrails, makes my hungry hounds a feast.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor lies she long, but as her fates ordain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Springs up to life, and, fresh to second pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Is saved to-day, to-morrow to be slain&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This, versed in death, the infernal knight relates,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And then for proof fulfilled their common fates;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her heart and bowels through her back he drew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And fed the hounds that helped him to pursue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stern looked the fiend, as frustrate of his will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not half sufficed, and greedy yet to kill.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And now the soul expiring through the wound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had left the body breathless on the ground,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When thus the grisly spectre spoke again:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Behold the fruit of ill-rewarded pain!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As many months as I sustained her hate,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So many years is she condemned by fate</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">To daily death; and every several place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Conscious of her disdain, and my disgrace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Must witness her just punishment; and be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A scene of triumph and revenge to me.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As in this grove I took my last farewell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As on this very spot of earth I fell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As Friday saw me die, so she my prey</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Becomes even here, on this revolving day.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus while he spoke, the virgin from the ground</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Upstarted fresh, already closed the wound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, unconcerned for all she felt before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Precipitates her flight along the shore:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The hell-hounds, as ungorged with flesh and blood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pursue their prey, and seek their wonted food:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fiend remounts his courser, mends his pace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And all the vision vanished from the place.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Long stood the noble youth oppressed with awe,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And stupid at the wondrous things he saw,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surpassing common faith, transgressing nature's law:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would have been asleep, and wished to wake,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But dreams, he knew, no long impression make,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though strong at first; if vision, to what end,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But such as must his future state portend?</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>His love the damsel, and himself the fiend.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But yet reflecting that it could not be</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From heaven, which cannot impious acts decree,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Resolved within himself to shun the snare,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which hell for his destruction did prepare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And as his better genius should direct,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From an ill cause to draw a good effect.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Inspired from heaven, he homeward took his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor palled his new design with long delay;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But of his train a trusty servant sent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To call his friends together at his tent.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They came, and usual salutations paid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With words premeditated thus he said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">What you have often counselled, to remove</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My vain pursuit of unregarded love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By thrift my sinking fortune to repair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though late, yet is at last become my care:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">My heart shall be my own; my vast expence</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Reduced to bounds, by timely providence:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This only I require; invite for me</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Honoria, with her father's family,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her friends, and mine, (the cause I shall display,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On Friday next; for that's the appointed day.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Well pleased were all his friends; the task was light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The father, mother, daughter, they invite;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hardly the dame was drawn to this repast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But yet resolved, because it was the last.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The day was come, the guests invited came,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, with the rest, the inexorable dame:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A feast prepared with riotous expence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Much cost, more care, and more magnificence.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The place ordained was in that haunted grove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where the revenging ghost pursued his love:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tables in a proud pavilion spread,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With flowers below, and tissue overhead:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rest in rank, Honoria, chief in place,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Was artfully contrived to set her face</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To front the thicket, and behold the chace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The feast was served, the time so well forecast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That just when the desert and fruits were placed,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fiend's alarm began; the hollow sound</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sung in the leaves, the forest shook around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Air blackened, rolled the thunder, groaned the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Nor long before the loud laments arise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of one distressed, and mastiffs' mingled cries;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And first the dame came rushing through the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And next the famished hounds that sought their food,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And griped her flanks, and oft essayed their jaws in blood.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Last came the felon, on the sable steed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Armed with his naked sword, and urged his dogs to speed.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She ran, and cried, her flight directly bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(A guest unbidden) to the fatal tent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The scene of death, and place ordained for punishment.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Loud was the noise, aghast was every guest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The women shrieked, the men forsook the feast;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hounds at nearer distance hoarsely bayed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hunter close pursued the visionary maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She rent the heaven with loud laments, imploring aid.</span><br />

  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The gallants to protect the lady's right,</span><br />

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>High on his stirrups he provoked the fight.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then on the crowd he cast a furious look,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And withered all their strength before he strook:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></span><br />
  <span class="i0">Back, on your lives! let be, said he, my prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And let my vengeance take the destined way:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Vain are your arms, and vainer your defence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Against the eternal doom of Providence:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mine is the ungrateful maid by heaven designed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Mercy she would not give, nor mercy shall she find.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">At this the former tale again he told</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With thundering tone, and dreadful to behold:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sunk were their hearts with horror of the crime,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor needed to be warned a second time,</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But bore each other back; some knew the face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And all had heard the much-lamented case</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of him who fell for love, and this the fatal place.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">And now the infernal minister advanced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Seized the due victim, and with fury lanced</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Her back, and piercing through her inmost heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Drew backward, as before, the offending part.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The reeking entrails next he tore away,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And to his meagre mastiffs made a prey.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The pale assistants on each other stared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With gaping mouths for issuing words prepared;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The still-born sounds upon the palate hung,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And died imperfect on the faultering tongue.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fright was general; but the female band</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A helpless train) in more confusion stand:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With horror shuddering, on a heap they run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sick at the sight of hateful justice done;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For conscience rung the alarm, and made the case their own.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So, spread upon a lake, with upward eye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A plump of fowl behold their foe on high;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They close their trembling troop; and all attend</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On whom the sowsing eagle will descend.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But most the proud Honoria feared the event,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thought to her alone the vision sent.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her guilt presents to her distracted mind</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Heaven's justice, Theodore's revengeful kind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the same fate to the same sin assigned;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Already sees herself the monster's prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And feels her heart and entrails torn away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas a mute scene of sorrow, mixed with fear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Still on the table lay the unfinished cheer:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The knight and hungry mastiffs stood around,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The mangled dame lay breathless on the ground;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When on a sudden, re-inspired with breath,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Again she rose, again to suffer death;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor stayed the hell-hounds, nor the hunter stayed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But followed, as before, the flying maid:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The avenger took from earth the avenging sword,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And mounting, light as air, his sable steed he spurred;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The clouds dispelled, the sky resumed her light,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And nature stood recovered of her fright.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">But fear, the last of ills, remained behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And horror heavy sat on every mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor Theodore encouraged more his feast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sternly looked, as hatching in his breast</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Some deep design; which when Honoria viewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fresh impulse her former fright renewed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She thought herself the trembling dame who fled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And him the grisly ghost that spurred the infernal steed:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The more dismayed, for when the guests withdrew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their courteous host, saluting all the crew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Regardless passed her o'er, nor graced with kind adieu.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That sting infixed within her haughty mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The downfal of her empire she divined;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And her proud heart with secret sorrow pined.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Home as they went, the sad discourse renewed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of the relentless dame to death pursued,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And of the sight obscene so lately viewed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">None durst arraign the righteous doom she bore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even they, who pitied most, yet blamed her more:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The parallel they needed not to name,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in the dead they damned the living dame.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At every little noise she looked behind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For still the knight was present to her mind:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And anxious oft she started on the way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And thought the horseman-ghost came thundering for his prey.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Returned, she took her bed, with little rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But in short slumbers dreamt the funeral feast:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Awaked, she turned her side, and slept again;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The same black vapours mounted in her brain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the same dreams returned with double pain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Now forced to wake, because afraid to sleep,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her blood all fevered, with a furious leap</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She sprung from bed, distracted in her mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And feared, at every step, a twitching sprite behind.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Darkling and desperate with a staggering pace,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of death afraid, and conscious of disgrace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fear, pride, remorse, at once her heart assailed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Pride put remorse to flight, but fear prevailed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Friday, the fatal day, when next it came,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her soul forethought the fiend would change his game,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And her pursue, or Theodore be slain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And two ghosts join their packs to hunt her o'er the plain.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">This dreadful image so possessed her mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That desperate any succour else to find,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She ceased all farther hope; and now began</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To make reflection on the unhappy man.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rich, brave, and young, who past expression loved,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Proof to disdain, and not to be removed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of all the men respected and admired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of all the dames, except herself, desired:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why not of her? preferred above the rest</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By him, with knightly deeds, and open love, professed?</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So had another been, where he his vows addressed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This quelled her pride, yet other doubts remained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, once disdaining, she might be disdained.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fear was just, but greater fear prevailed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fear of her life by hellish hounds assailed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He took a lowering leave; but who can tell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">What outward hate might inward love conceal?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her sex's arts she knew, and why not, then,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Might deep dissembling have a place in men?</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here hope began to dawn; resolved to try,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She fixed on this her utmost remedy;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Death was behind, but hard it was to die.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>'Twas time enough at last on death to call,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The precipice in sight: a shrub was all,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That kindly stood betwixt to break the fatal fall.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">One maid she had, beloved above the rest;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Secure of her, the secret she confessed;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Secure of her, the secret she confessed;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And now the cheerful light her fears dispelled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She with no winding turns the truth concealed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But put the woman off, and stood revealed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With faults confessed commissioned her to go,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">If pity yet had place, and reconcile her foe.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The welcome message made, was soon received;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">'Twas what he wished, and hoped, but scarce believed;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fate seemed a fair occasion to present,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He knew the sex, and feared she might repent,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">There yet remained to gain her friends, (a care</span><br />

  <span class="i0">But she with such a zeal the cause embraced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(As women, where they will, are all in haste,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That father, mother, and the kin beside,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were overborne by fury of the tide:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With full consent of all she changed her state;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Resistless in her love, as in her hate.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By her example warned, the rest beware;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More easy, less imperious, were the fair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And that one hunting, which the devil designed</span><br />

<h3>ORIGINAL, FROM THE DECAMERON.</h3>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="p3">THE FIFTH DAY.</p>

<p class="p1">NOVEL VIII.</p>


<blockquote><p><em>Anastasio being in love with a young lady, spent a good part of his
fortune without being able to gain her affections. At the request
of his relations he retires to Chiassi, where he sees a lady pursued
and slain by a gentleman, and then given to the dogs to be devoured.
He invites his friends, along with his mistress, to come
and dine with him, when they see the same thing, and she, fearing
the like punishment, takes him for her husband.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>When Lauretta had made an end, Philomena began, by the
queen's command, thus: Most gracious lady, as pity is a commendable
quality in us, in like manner do we find cruelty most
severely punished by divine justice; which, that I may make plain
to you all, and afford means to drive it from your hearts, I mean
to relate a novel as full of compassion as it is agreeable.</p>

<p>In Ravenna, an ancient city of Romagna, dwelt formerly many
persons of quality; amongst the rest was a young gentleman
named Anastasio de gli Honesti, who, by the deaths of his father
and uncle, was left immensely rich; and, being a bachelor, fell in
love with one of the daughters of Signor Paolo Traversaro (of a
family much superior to his own) and was in hopes, by his constant
application, to gain her affection: but though his endeavours
were generous, noble, and praise-worthy, so far were they from
succeeding, that, on the contrary, they rather turned out to his
disadvantage; and so cruel, and even savage, was the beloved fair
one, (either her singular beauty, or noble descent, having made her
thus haughty and scornful,) that neither he, nor any thing that he
did, could ever please her. This so afflicted Anastasio, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
was going to lay violent hands upon himself; but, thinking better
of it, he frequently thought to leave her entirely; or else to hate
her, if he could, as much as she had hated him. But this proved
a vain design; for he constantly found that the less his hope, the
greater always his love. Persevering then in his love and extravagant
way of life, his friends looked upon him as destroying
his constitution, as well as wasting his substance; they therefore
advised and entreated that he would leave the place, and go and
live somewhere else; for, by that means, he might lessen both his
love and expence. For some time he made light of this advice,
till being very much importuned, and not knowing how to refuse
them, he promised to do so; when, making extraordinary preparations,
as if he was going some long journey either into France
or Spain, he mounted his horse and left Ravenna, attended by
many of his friends, and went to a place about three miles off,
called Chiassi, where he ordered tents and pavilions to be brought,
telling those who had accompanied him, that he meant to stay
there, but that they might return to Ravenna. Here he lived in
the most splendid manner, inviting sometimes this company, and
sometimes that, both to dine and sup as he had used to do before.
Now it happened in the beginning of May, the season being extremely
pleasant, that, thinking of his cruel mistress, he ordered all
his family to retire, and leave him to his own thoughts, when he
walked along, step by step, and lost in reflection, till he came to
a forest of pines. It being then the fifth hour of the day, and he
advanced more than half a mile into the grove, without thinking
either of his dinner, or any thing else but his love, on a sudden he
seemed to hear a most grievous lamentation, with the loud shrieks
of a woman: this put an end to his meditation, when, looking
round him, to know what the matter was, he saw come out of a
thicket full of briers and thorns, and run towards the place where
he was, a most beautiful lady, naked, with her flesh all scratched
and rent by the bushes, crying terribly, and begging for mercy:
in close pursuit of her were two fierce mastiffs, biting and tearing
wherever they could lay hold, and behind, upon a black steed,
rode a gloomy knight, with a dagger in his hand, loading her with
the bitterest imprecations. The sight struck him at once with
wonder and consternation, as well as pity for the lady, whom he
was desirous to rescue from such trouble and danger, if possible;
but finding himself without arms, he seized the branch of a tree,
instead of a truncheon, and went forward with it, to oppose both
the dogs and the knight. The knight observing this, called out,
afar off, "Anastasio, do not concern thyself; but leave the dogs
and me to do by this wicked woman as she has deserved." At these
words the dogs laid hold of her, and he coming up to them, dismounted
from his horse. Anastasio then stept up to him, and said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
"I know not who you are, that are acquainted thus with me; but
I must tell you, that it is a most villainous action for a man armed
as you are to pursue a naked woman, and to set dogs upon her
also, as if she were a wild beast; be assured, that I shall defend
her to the utmost of my power." The knight replied, "I was
once your countryman, when you were but a child, and was called
Guido de gli Anastagi, at which time I was more enamoured
with this woman, than ever you were with Traversaro's daughter;
but she treated me so cruelly, and with so much insolence, that I
killed myself with this dagger which you now see in my hand, for
which I am doomed to eternal punishment. Soon afterwards she,
who was over and above rejoiced at my death, died likewise, and
for that cruelty, as also for the joy which she expressed at my
misery, she is condemned as well as myself; our sentences are for
her to flee before me, and for me, who loved her so well, to pursue
her as a mortal enemy; and when I overtake her, with this
dagger, with which I murdered myself, do I murder her; then
I open her through the back, and take out that hard and cold
heart, which neither love nor pity could pierce, with all her entrails,
and throw them to the dogs; and in a little time (so wills
the justice and power of heaven) she rises, as though she had never
been dead, and renews her miserable flight, whilst we pursue
her over again. Every Friday in the year, about this time, do I
sacrifice her here, as you see, and on other days in other places,
where she has ever thought or done any thing against me; and
thus being from a lover become her mortal enemy, I am to follow
her as many years as she was cruel to me months. Then let the
divine justice take its course, nor offer to oppose what you are no
way able to withstand." Anastasio drew back at these words, terrified
to death, and waited to see what the other was going to do:
who having made an end of speaking, ran at her with the utmost
fury, as she was seized by the dogs, and kneeled down begging for
mercy, when with his dagger he pierced through her breast, drawing
forth her heart and entrails, which they immediately, as if half
famished, devoured. And in a little time she rose again, as if nothing
had happened, and fled towards the sea, the dogs biting and
tearing her all the way, the knight also being remounted, and
taking his dagger, pursued her as before, till they soon got out of
sight. Upon seeing these things, Anastasio stood divided betwixt
fear and pity, and at length it came into his mind that, as it happened
always on a Friday, it might be of particular use. Returning
then to his servants, he sent for some of his friends and relations,
when he said to them, "You have often importuned me to
leave off loving this my enemy, and to contract my expences; I
am ready to do so, provided you grant me one favour, which is
this, that next Friday, you engage Paolo Traversaro, his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
daughter, with all their women-friends and relations to come and
dine with me: the reason of my requiring this you will see at that
time." This seemed to them a small matter, and returning to
Ravenna they invited all those whom he had desired, and though
they found it difficult to prevail upon the young lady, yet the
others carried her at last along with them. Anastasio had provided
a magnificent entertainment in the grove where that spectacle
had lately been; and, having seated all his company, he contrived
that the lady should sit directly opposite to the scene of action.
The last course then was no sooner served up, but the lady's
shrieks began to be heard. This surprised them all, and they began
to enquire what it was, and, as nobody could inform them,
they all arose; when immediately they saw the lady, dogs, and
knight, who were soon amongst them. Great was consequently the
clamour, both against the dogs and knight, and many of them went to
her assistance. But the knight made the same harangue to them,
that he had done to Anastasio, which terrified and filled them
with wonder; whilst he acted the same part over again, the ladies,
of whom there were many present, related to both the knight and
lady, who remembered his love and unhappy death, all lamenting
as much as if it happened to themselves. This tragical affair being
ended, and the lady and knight both gone away, they had various
arguments together about it; but none seemed so much affected
as Anastasio's mistress, who had heard and seen every thing
distinctly, and was sensible that it concerned her more than any
other person, calling to mind her usage of and cruelty towards
him; so that she seemed to flee before him all incensed, with the
mastiffs at her heels; and her terror was such, lest this should
ever happen to her, that, turning her hatred into love, she sent
that very evening a trusty damsel privately to him, who entreated
him in her name to come to see her, for that she was ready to fulfil
his desires. Anastasio replied, that nothing could be more agreeable
to him; but that he desired no favour from her, but what was
consistent with her honour. The lady, who was sensible that it
had been always her fault they were not married, answered, that
she was willing; and going herself to her father and mother, she
acquainted them with her intention. This gave them the utmost
satisfaction; and the next Sunday the marriage was solemnized
with all possible demonstrations of joy. And that spectacle was
not attended with this good alone; but all the women of Ravenna,
for the time to come, were so terrified with it, that they were
more ready to listen to, and oblige the men, than ever they had
been before.</p>

<h3>CYMON AND IPHIGENIA.</h3>


<p>Beroaldus, who translated this novel into Latin, and published
it in Paris in 1499, affirms, that it is taken from the annals
of the kingdom of Cyprus; and from his intimacy with Hugo
IV., king of that island, may perhaps have had grounds for saying
so, besides Boccaccio's own allegation to the same effect. Whether
entirely fictitious, or grounded upon historical fact, it is one of those
novels which have added most to the reputation of the "Decameron;"
nor has the version of Dryden been the least admired among
his poems. This popularity seems entirely due to the primary incident,
the reforming of Cymon from his barbarism and idiocy, by
the influence of a passion, which almost all have felt at one period
of their life, and love to read and hear of ever afterwards. Perhaps
the original idea of Cymon's conversion is to be found in the
Idyl of Theocritus, entitled &#914;&#927;&#933;&#922;&#927;&#923;&#921;&#931;&#922;&#927;&#931;. There is not in our
language a strain of more beautiful and melodious poetry, than
that so often quoted, in which Dryden describes the sleeping
nymph, and the effect of her beauty upon the clownish Cymon.
But it is only sufficient to mention that passage, to recal it to the
recollection of every general reader, and of most who have read
any poetry at all. The narrative, it must be confessed, is otherwise
inartificial, and bears little proportion, or even reference, to
this most striking and original incident. Cymon might have carried
off Iphigene, and all the changes of fortune which afterwards
take place might have happened, though his love had commenced
in an ordinary manner; nor is there any thing in his character or
mode of conduct, which calls back to our recollection, his having
such a miraculous instance of the power of love. In short, in the
progress of the tale, we quite lose sight of its original and striking
commencement; nor do we find much compensation by the introduction
of the new actor Lysander, with whose passion and disappointment
we have little sympathy; and whose expedients, as Dryden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
plainly confesses, are no other than an abuse of his public office
by the commission of murder and rape. These are perhaps too critical
objections to a story, which Dryden took from Boccaccio, as Boccaccio
had probably taken it from some old annalist, as containing
a striking instance of the power of the gentler affections, in regulating
and refining the human mind, and a curious illustration
of the mutability of fortune, in the subsequent incidents attending
the loves of Cymon and Iphigene.</p>

<p>Dryden, in the introductory verses, has hazarded a more direct
attack upon Collier, than his consciousness of having merited his
accusations had yet permitted him to bring forward.</p>

  <span class="i0">Wise, wealthy, with a numerous issue blessed.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>

  <span class="i0">Fair, tall, his limbs with due proportion joined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But of a heavy, dull, degenerate mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His soul belied the features of his face;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Beauty was there, but beauty in disgrace.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A clownish mein, a voice with rustic sound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And stupid eyes that ever loved the ground.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He looked like nature's error, as the mind</span><br />

  <span class="i1">The ruling rod, the father's forming care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Were exercised in vain on wit's despair;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The more informed, the less he understood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And deeper sunk by floundering in the mud.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now scorned of all, and grown the public shame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The people from Galesus changed his name,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Cymon called, which signifies a brute;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So well his name did with his nature suit.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His father, when he found his labour lost,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And care employed, that answered not the cost,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Chose an ungrateful object to remove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And loathed to see what nature made him love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So to his country farm the fool confined;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rude work well suited with a rustic mind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus to the wilds the sturdy Cymon went,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A squire among the swains, and pleased with banishment.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">And his supreme delight, a country fair.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It happened on a summer's holiday,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That to the green-wood shade he took his way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For Cymon shunned the church, and used not much to pray.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">His quarter-staff, which he could ne'er forsake,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Hung half before, and half behind his back.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He trudged along, unknowing what he sought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And whistled as he went, for want of thought.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">By chance conducted, or by thirst constrained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The deep recesses of the grove he gained;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where in a plain defended by the wood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Crept through the matted grass a crystal flood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By which an alabaster fountain stood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And on the margin of the fount was laid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(Attended by her slaves) a sleeping maid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Like Dian and her nymphs, when, tired with sport,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To rest by cool Eurotas they resort.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dame herself the goddess well expressed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not more distinguished by her purple vest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than by the charming features of her face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And even in slumber a superior grace;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her comely limbs composed with decent care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her body shaded with a slight cymarr;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her bosom to the view was only bare;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where two beginning paps were scarcely spied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For yet their places were but signified:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fanning wind upon her bosom blows,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To meet the fanning wind the bosom rose;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fanning wind, and purling streams, continue her repose.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The fool of nature stood with stupid eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And gaping mouth, that testified surprise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fixed on her face, nor could remove his sight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">New as he was to love, and novice in delight;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long mute he stood, and, leaning on his staff,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His wonder witnessed with an idiot laugh;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then would have spoke, but by his glimmering sense,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">First found his want of words, and feared offence;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Doubted for what he was he should be known,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By his clown accent, and his country tone.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
  <span class="i1">Through the rude chaos thus the running light</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Shot the first ray that pierced the native night;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then day and darkness in the mass were mixed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till gathered in a globe the beams were fixed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Last shone the sun, who, radiant in his sphere,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Illumined heaven and earth, and rolled around the year.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So reason in this brutal soul began:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love made him first suspect he was a man;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love made him doubt his broad barbarian sound;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By love his want of words, and wit, he found;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That sense of want prepared the future way</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To knowledge, and disclosed the promise of a day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">What not his father's care, nor tutor's art,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Could plant with pains in his unpolished heart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The best instructor, love, at once inspired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As barren grounds to fruitfulness are fired;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love taught him shame, and shame, with love at strife,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Soon taught the sweet civilities of life.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His gross material soul at once could find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Somewhat in her excelling all her kind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Exciting a desire till then unknown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Somewhat unfound, or found in her alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This made the first impression in his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Above, but just above, the brutal kind.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For beasts can like, but not distinguish too,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor their own liking by reflection know;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor why they like or this or t'other face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or judge of this, or that peculiar grace;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But love in gross, and stupidly admire;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As flies, allured by light, approach the fire.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus our man-beast, advancing by degrees,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">First likes the whole, then separates what he sees;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">On several parts a several praise bestows,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The ruby lips, the well-proportioned nose,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The snowy skin, the raven-glossy hair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The dimpled cheek, the forehead rising fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And even in sleep itself, a smiling air.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From thence his eyes descending viewed the rest,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her plump round arms, white hands, and heaving breast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Long on the last he dwelt, though every part</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A pointed arrow sped to pierce his heart.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus in a trice a judge of beauty grown,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(A judge erected from a country clown,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He longed to see her eyes, in slumber hid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And wished his own could pierce within the lid:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He would have waked her, but restrained his thought,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And love new-born the first good manners taught.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">An awful fear his ardent wish withstood,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor durst disturb the goddess of the wood;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For such she seemed by her celestial face,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Excelling all the rest of human race;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And things divine, by common sense he knew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Must be devoutly seen at distant view:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So checking his desire, with trembling heart</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Gazing he stood, nor would, nor could depart;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fixed as a pilgrim wildered in his way,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who dares not stir by night, for fear to stray,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But stands with awful eyes to watch the dawn of day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">At length awaking, Iphigene the fair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(So was the beauty called, who caused his care,)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Unclosed her eyes, and double day revealed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While those of all her slaves in sleep were sealed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The slavering cudden, propped upon his staff,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stood ready gaping with a grinning laugh,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To welcome her awake, nor durst begin</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To speak, but wisely kept the fool within.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then she; What make you, Cymon, here alone?&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For Cymon's name was round the country known,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Because descended of a noble race,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">(And for a soul ill sorted with his face.)</span><br />
  <span class="i1">But still the sot stood silent with surprise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With fixed regard on her new-opened eyes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And in his breast received the envenomed dart,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A tickling pain that pleased amid the smart.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But conscious of her form, with quick distrust</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She saw his sparkling eyes, and feared his brutal lust;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This to prevent, she waked her sleepy crew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, rising hasty, took a short adieu.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then Cymon first his rustic voice essayed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With proffered service to the parting maid</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To see her safe; his hand she long denied,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But took at length, ashamed of such a guide.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So Cymon led her home, and leaving there,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">No more would to his country clowns repair,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But sought his father's house, with better mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Refusing in the farm to be confined.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The father wondered at the son's return,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And knew not whether to rejoice or mourn;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But doubtfully received, expecting still</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To learn the secret causes of his altered will.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor was he long delayed; the first request</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He made, was like his brothers to be dress'd,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, as his birth required, above the rest.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">With ease his suit was granted by his sire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Distinguishing his heir by rich attire:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His body thus adorned, he next designed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">With liberal arts to cultivate his mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He sought a tutor of his own accord,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And studied lessons he before abhorred.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Thus the man-child advanced, and learned so fast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That in short time his equals he surpassed:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His brutal manners from his breast exiled,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His mien he fashioned, and his tongue he filed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In every exercise of all admired,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He seemed, nor only seemed, but was inspired;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Inspired by love, whose business is to please;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He rode, he fenced, he moved with graceful ease,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More famed for sense, for courtly carriage more,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than for his brutal folly known before.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">What then of altered Cymon shall we say,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But that the fire which choked in ashes lay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A load too heavy for his soul to move,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Was upward blown below, and brushed away by love.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love made an active progress through his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The dusky parts he cleared, the gross refined,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The drowsy waked; and, as he went, impressed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The Maker's image on the human breast.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus was the man amended by desire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, though he loved perhaps with too much fire,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">His father all his faults with reason scan'd,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And liked an error of the better hand;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Excused the excess of passion in his mind,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By flames too fierce, perhaps too much refined;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">So Cymon, since his sire indulged his will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Impetuous loved, and would be Cymon still;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Galesus he disowned, and chose to bear</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The name of fool, confirmed and bishoped by the fair.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To Cipseus by his friends his suit he moved,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cipseus, the father of the fair he loved;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But he was pre-engaged by former ties,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While Cymon was endeavouring to be wise;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Iphigene, obliged by former vows,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Had given her faith to wed a foreign spouse:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her sire and she to Rhodian Pasimond,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though both repenting, were by promise bound,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor could retract; and thus, as fate decreed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though better loved, he spoke too late to speed.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The doom was past; the ship already sent</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Did all his tardy diligence prevent;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sighed to herself the fair unhappy maid,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While stormy Cymon thus in secret said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">The time is come for Iphigene to find</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The miracle she wrought upon my mind;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her charms have made me man, her ravished love</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In rank shall place me with the blessed above.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For mine by love, by force she shall be mine,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or death, if force should fail, shall finish my design.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Resolved he said; and rigged with speedy care</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A vessel strong, and well equipped for war.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The secret ship with chosen friends he stored;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And bent to die, or conquer, went aboard.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ambushed he lay behind the Cyprian shore,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Waiting the sail that all his wishes bore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor long expected, for the following tide</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Sent out the hostile ship and beauteous bride.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">To Rhodes the rival bark directly steered,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When Cymon sudden at her back appeared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And stopped her flight; then standing on his prow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In haughty terms he thus defied the foe:&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or strike your sails at summons, or prepare</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To prove the last extremities of war.&mdash;</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus warned, the Rhodians for the fight provide;</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Already were the vessels side by side,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These obstinate to save, and those to seize the bride.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But Cymon soon his crooked grapples cast,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Which with tenacious hold his foes embraced,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And, armed with sword and shield, amid the press he passed.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Fierce was the fight, but, hastening to his prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By force the furious lover freed his way;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Himself alone dispersed the Rhodian crew,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The weak disdained, the valiant overthrew;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cheap conquest for his following friends remained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He reaped the field, and they but only gleaned.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">His victory confessed, the foes retreat,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cast their weapons at the victor's feet.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Whom thus he cheared:&mdash;O Rhodian youth, I fought</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For love alone, nor other booty sought;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Your lives are safe; your vessel I resign,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yours be your own, restoring what is mine:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In Iphigene I claim my rightful due,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Robbed by my rival, and detained by you;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your Pasimond a lawless bargain drove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The parent could not sell the daughter's love;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or if he could, my love disdains the laws,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, like a king, by conquest gains his cause;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Where arms take place, all other pleas are vain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Love taught me force, and force shall love maintain.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">You, what by strength you could not keep, release,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And at an easy ransom buy your peace.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Fear on the conquered side soon signed the accord,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And Iphigene to Cymon was restored.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While to his arms the blushing bride he took,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To seeming sadness she composed her look;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As if by force subjected to his will,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Though pleased, dissembling, and a woman still.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And, for she wept, he wiped her falling tears,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And prayed her to dismiss her empty fears;&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For yours I am, he said, and have deserved</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your love much better whom so long I served,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than he to whom your formal father tied</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Your vows, and sold a slave, not sent a bride.&mdash;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus while he spoke, he seized the willing prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">As Paris bore the Spartan spouse away.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Faintly she screamed, and even her eyes confessed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She rather would be thought, than was, distressed.</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Secure of fate, while Cymon plows the sea,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And steers to Candy with his conquered prey,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Scarce the third glass of measured hours was run,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">When like a fiery meteor sunk the sun,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The promise of a storm; the shifting gales</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forsake by fits, and fill, the flagging sails;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Hoarse murmurs of the main from far were heard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And night came on, not by degrees prepared,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But all at once; at once the winds arise,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The thunders roll, the forky lightning flies.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In vain the master issues out commands,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In vain the trembling sailors ply their hands;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The tempest unforeseen prevents their care,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And from the first they labour in despair.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The giddy ship, betwixt the winds and tides</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Forced back and forwards, in a circle rides,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stunned with the different blows; then shoots amain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till, counterbuffed, she stops, and sleeps again.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not more aghast the proud archangel fell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Plunged from the height of heaven to deepest hell,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Than stood the lover of his love possessed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Now cursed the more, the more he had been blessed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">More anxious for her danger, than his own,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Death he defies, but would be lost alone.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Sad Iphigene to womanish complaints</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Adds pious prayers, and wearies all the saints;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Even, if she could, her love she would repent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But since she cannot, dreads the punishment:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Her forfeit faith, and Pasimond betrayed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Are ever present, and her crime upbraid.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She blames herself, nor blames her lover less,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Augments her anger, as her fears increase:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">From her own back the burden would remove,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And lays the load on his ungoverned love,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Which interposing durst, in heaven's despite,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Invade, and violate another's right:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The powers incensed awhile deferred his pain,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And made him master of his vows in vain:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But soon they punished his presumptuous pride,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That for his daring enterprise she died,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who rather not resisted, than complied.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Then, impotent of mind, with altered sense,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">She hugged the offender, and forgave the offence,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
  <span class="i0">Sex to the last: meantime with sails declined</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The wandering vessel drove before the wind:</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tossed and retossed, aloft, and then alow,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nor port they seek, nor certain course they know,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But every moment wait the coming blow.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Thus blindly driven, by breaking day they viewed</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The land before them, and their fears renewed;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The land was welcome, but the tempest bore</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The threatened ship against a rocky shore.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">A winding bay was near; to this they bent,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And just escaped; their force already spent:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Secure from storms, and panting from the sea,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The land unknown at leisure they survey;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And saw (but soon their sickly sight withdrew)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The rising towers of Rhodes at distant view;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And cursed the hostile shore of Pasimond,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Saved from the seas, and shipwrecked on the ground.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The frighted sailors tried their strength in vain</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To turn the stern, and tempt the stormy main;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But the stiff wind withstood the labouring oar,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And forced them forward on the fatal shore!</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The crooked keel now bites the Rhodian strand,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And the ship moored constrains the crew to land:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Yet still they might be safe, because unknown;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, as ill fortune seldom comes alone,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The vessel they dismissed was driven before,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Already sheltered on their native shore;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Known each, they know, but each with change of chear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The vanquished side exults, the victors fear;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Not them but theirs, made prisoners ere they fight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Despairing conquest, and deprived of flight.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The country rings around with loud alarms,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Mouths without hands; maintained at vast expence,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In peace a charge, in war a weak defence;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Stout once a month they march, a blustering band,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And ever, but in times of need, at hand:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">This was the morn when, issuing on the guard,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Drawn up in rank and file they stood prepared</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of seeming arms to make a short essay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Then hasten to be drunk, the business of the day.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The cowards would have fled, but that they knew</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Themselves so many, and their foes so few;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But, crowding on, the last the first impel,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Till overborne with weight the Cyprians fell;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Cymon enslaved, who first the war begun,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Deprived of day, and held in fetters fast;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">What worse to Cymon could his fortune deal,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Rolled to the lowest spoke of all her wheel?</span><br />
  <span class="i0">It rested to dismiss the downward weight,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Or raise him upward to his former height:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The latter pleased; and love (concerned the most)</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Prepared the amends, for what by love he lost.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">The sire of Pasimond had left a son,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Crossed by her friends, by her not disapproved,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">So stood the affair; some little hope remained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That, should his rival chance to lose, he gained.</span><br />
  <span class="i1">Meantime young Pasimond his marriage pressed,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Ordained the nuptial day, prepared the feast;</span><br />

  <span class="i1">Lysimachus, oppressed with mortal grief,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Received the news, and studied quick relief:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The fatal day approached; if force were used,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The magistrate his public trust abused;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">To justice liable, as law required,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">For when his office ceased, his power expired:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">While power remained, the means were in his hand</span><br />
  <span class="i0">By force to seize, and then forsake the land:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Betwixt extremes he knew not how to move,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">A slave to fame, but more a slave to love:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Restraining others, yet himself not free,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Made impotent by power, debased by dignity.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Both sides he weighed; but after much debate,</span><br />

  <span class="i1"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Love never fails to master what he finds,</span><br />

  <span class="i1">Thus far they tried you, and by proof they found</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The grain intrusted in a grateful ground:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But still the great experiment remained,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">They suffered you to lose the prize you gained,</span><br />

<h3>ORIGINAL, FROM THE DECAMERON.</h3>

<hr class="r15" />

<p class="p3">THE FIFTH DAY.</p>

<p class="p1">NOVEL I.</p>


<blockquote>

<p><em>Cymon becomes wise by being in love, and by force of arms wins
Ephigenia his mistress upon the seas, and is imprisoned at Rhodes.
Being delivered from thence by Lysimachus, with him he recovers
Ephigenia, and flies with her to Crete, where he is married to her,
and is afterwards recalled home.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A great many novels come now fresh into my mind, for the
beginning of such an agreeable day's discourse as this is likely to
be; but one I am more particularly pleased with, because it not
only shews the happy conclusion which we are to treat about, but
how sacred, how powerful also, as well as advantageous, the force
of love is; which some people, without knowing what they say,
unjustly blame and vilify, and which I judge will rather be had
in esteem by you, as I suppose you all to be subject to the tender
passion.</p>

<p>According to the ancient histories of Cyprus, there lived sometime
in that island, one of great rank and distinction, called Aristippus,
by far the wealthiest person in all the country; and if he
was unhappy in any one respect, it was in having, amongst his
other children, a son, who, though he exceeded most young people
of his time in stature and comeliness, yet was he a perfect natural;
his true name was Galeso, but as neither the labour nor
skill of his master, nor the correction of his father, was ever able to
beat one letter into his head, or the least instruction of any kind,
and as his voice and manner of speaking were strangely harsh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
uncouth, he was, by way of disdain, called only Cymon; which,
in their language, signified <em>beast</em>. The father had long beheld him
with infinite concern; and as all hopes were vanished concerning
him, to remove out of his sight an object which afforded constant
matter of grief, he ordered him away to his country-house, to be
there with his slaves. This was extremely agreeable to Cymon,
because people of that sort had been always most to his mind.
Residing there, and doing all sorts of drudgery pertaining to that
kind of life, it happened one day, as he was going, about noontide,
with his staff upon his shoulder, from one farm to another,
that he passed through a pleasant grove, which, as it was then the
month of May, was all in bloom; from whence, as his stars led
him, he came into a meadow surrounded with high trees, in one
corner of which was a crystal spring, and by the side of it, upon
the grass, lay a most beautiful damsel asleep, clothed with a mantle
so exceedingly fine and delicate, as scarcely to conceal underneath
the exquisite whiteness of her skin; only from her waist downwards
she wore a white silken quilt, and at her feet were sleeping
likewise two women and a man servant. As soon as Cymon cast
his eye upon her, as if he had never seen the face of a woman before,
he stood leaning upon his staff, and began to gaze with the
utmost astonishment, without speaking a word. When suddenly in
his rude uncivilized breast, which had hitherto been incapable of
receiving the least impression of politeness whatsoever, a sudden
thought arose, which seemed to intimate to his gross and shallow
understanding, that this was the most agreeable sight that ever was
seen. From thence he began to examine each part by itself, commending
every limb and feature; and being now become a judge
of beauty from a mere idiot, he grew very desirous of seeing her
eyes, on which account he was going several times to wake her;
but as she so far excelled all other women that he ever saw, he
was in doubt whether she was a mortal creature. This made
him wait to see if she would awake of her own accord; and
though that expectation seemed tedious to him, yet so pleasing
was the object, that he had no power to leave it. After a long
time she came to herself, and raising up her head, saw Cymon
stand propt upon his stick before her, at which she was surprised,
and said: "Cymon, what are you looking for here at this time of
day?" Now he was known all over the country, as well for
his own rusticity, as his father's nobility and great wealth. He
made no answer, but stood with his eyes fixed upon hers, which
seemed to dart a sweetness, that filled him with a kind of joy to
which he had hitherto been a stranger; whilst she observing this,
and not knowing what his rudeness might prompt him to, called
up her women, and then said: "Cymon, go about your business."
He replied, "I will go along with you." And though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
she was afraid, and would have avoided his company, yet he would
not leave her till he had brought her to her own house; from
thence he went home to his father, when he declared, that he
would return no more into the country, which was very disagreeable
to all his friends, but yet they let him alone, waiting to see
what this change of temper could be owing to. Love thus having
pierced his heart, when no lesson of any kind could ever find admittance,
in a little time his way of thinking and behaviour were
so far changed, that his father and friends were strangely surprised
at it, as well as every body that knew him. First of all
then, he asked his father to let him have clothes, and every thing
else like his brethren; to which the father very willingly consented.
Conversing too with young gentlemen of character, and observing
their ways and manner of behaving, in a very short time
he not only got over the first rudiments of learning, but attained
to some knowledge in philosophy. Afterwards, his love for Ephigenia
being the sole cause of it, his rude and rustic speech was
changed into a tone more agreeable and civilized: he grew also
a master of music: and with regard to the military art, as well by
sea as land, he became as expert and gallant as the best. In
short, not to run over all his excellencies, before the expiration of
the fourth year from his being first in love, he turned out the
most accomplished young gentleman in every respect that ever
Cyprus could boast of. What then, most gracious ladies, shall
we say of Cymon? Surely nothing less than this; that all the noble
qualities, which had been infused by heaven into his generous
soul, were shut up as it were by invidious fortune, and bound
fast with the strongest fetters in a small corner of his heart, till
love broke the enchantment, and drove with all its might these virtues
out of that cruel obscurity, to which they had been long
doomed, to a clear and open day; plainly shewing from whence
it draws those spirits that are its votaries, and whither its mighty
influence conducts them. Cymon, therefore, though he might
have his flights like other young people, with regard to his love
for Ephigenia, yet when Aristippus considered it was that had
made a man of him, he not only bore with it, but encouraged him
in the pursuit of his pleasures. Cymon, nevertheless, who refused
to be called Galeso, remembering that Ephigenia had styled
him Cymon, being desirous of bringing that affair to an happy
conclusion, had often requested her in marriage of her father, who
replied, that he had already promised her to one Pasimunda, a
young nobleman of Rhodes, and that he intended not to break his
word. The time then being come, that was appointed for their
nuptials, and the husband having sent in form to demand her, Cymon
said to himself: O, Ephigenia, the time is now come when I
shall give proof how I love you! I am become a man on your account;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
and could I but obtain you, I should be as glorious and
happy as the gods themselves; and have you I will, or else I will
die. Immediately he prevailed upon some young noblemen who
were his friends, to assist him; and, fitting out a ship of war privately,
they put to sea, in order to way-lay the vessel that was to
transport Ephigenia; who, after great respect and honour shewed
by her father to her husband's friends, embarked with them for
Rhodes. Cymon, who had but little rest that night, overtook
them on the following day, when he called out, "Stop, and strike
your sails; or expect to go to the bottom of the sea." They, on
the other hand, had got all their arms above deck, and were preparing
for a vigorous defence. He therefore threw a grappling
iron upon the other ship, which was making the best of its way,
and drew it close to his own; when, like a lion, without waiting
for any one to second him, he jumped singly among his enemies,
as if he cared not for them, and, love spurring him on with incredible
force, he cut and drove them all like so many sheep before
him, till they soon threw down their arms, acknowledging themselves
his prisoners; when he addressed himself to them in the
following manner: "Gentlemen, it is no desire of plunder, nor
enmity to any of your company, that made me leave Cyprus to
fall upon you here in this manner. What occasioned it is a matter,
the success of which is of the utmost consequence to myself,
and as easy for you quietly to grant me: it is Ephigenia, whom I love
above all the world; and as I could not have her from her father
peaceably, and as a friend, my love constrains me to win her from
you as an enemy, by force of arms. Therefore I am resolved to
be to her what your Pasimunda was to have been. Resign her
then to me, and go away in God's name." The people, more by
force than any good will, gave her, all in tears, up to Cymon;
who seeing her lament in that manner, said: "Fair lady, be not
discouraged; I am your Cymon, who have a better claim to your
affection, on account of my long and constant love, than Pasimunda
can have by virtue of a promise." Taking her then on
board his ship, without meddling with any thing else that belonged
to them, he suffered them to depart. Cymon thus being the
most overjoyed man that could be, after comforting the lady under
her calamity, consulted with his friends what to do, who were
of opinion that they should by no means return to Cyprus yet;
but that it were better to go directly to Crete, where they had all
relations and friends, but Cymon especially, on which account
they might be more secure there along with Ephigenia; and accordingly
they directed their course that way. But fortune, who
had given the lady to Cymon by an easy conquest, soon changed
his immoderate joy into most sad and bitter lamentation. In
about four hours from his parting with the Rhodians, night came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
upon them, which was more welcome to Cymon than any of the
rest, and with it a most violent tempest, which overspread the face
of the heavens in such a manner, that they could neither see what
they did, nor whither they were carried; nor were they able at
all to steer the ship. You may easily suppose what Cymon's
grief must be on this occasion. He concluded, that heaven had
crowned his desires only to make death more grievous to him,
which before would have been but little regarded. His friends
also were greatly affected, but especially Ephigenia, who trembled
at every shock, still sharply upbraiding his ill-timed love, and
declaring that this tempest was sent by Providence for no other
reason, but that as he had resolved to have her, contrary to the
will and disposal of heaven, to disappoint that presumption; and
that, seeing her die first, he might die likewise in the same miserable
manner. Amongst such complaints as these, they were carried
at last, the wind growing continually more violent, near the
island of Rhodes; and not knowing where they were, they endeavoured,
for the safety of their lives, to get to land if possible.
In this they succeeded, and got into a little bay, where the Rhodian
ship had arrived just before them; nor did they know they
were at Rhodes till the next morning, when they saw, about a
bow-shot from them, the same ship they had parted with the day
before. Cymon was greatly concerned at this; and fearing what
afterwards came to pass, he bid them put to sea if possible, and
trust to fortune, for they could never be in a worse place. They
used all possible means then to get out, but in vain; the wind was
strongly against them, and drove them to shore in spite of all
they could do to prevent it. They were soon known by the sailors
of the other ship, who had now gained the shore, and who ran to
a neighbouring town, where the young gentlemen that had been
on board were just gone before, and informed them how Cymon
and Ephigenia were, like themselves, driven thither by stress of
weather. They, hearing this, brought a great many people from
the town to the sea-side, and took Cymon and his companions prisoners,
who had got on shore, with a design of flying to a neighbouring
wood, as also Ephigenia, and brought them all together to
the town. Pasimunda, upon hearing the news, went and made his
complaints to the senate, who accordingly sent Lysimachus, who
was chief magistrate that year, along with a guard of soldiers, to
conduct them to prison. Thus the miserable and enamoured Cymon
lost his mistress soon after he had gained her, and without
having scarcely so much as a kiss for his pains. In the mean time
Ephigenia was handsomely received by many ladies of quality, and
comforted for the trouble she had sustained in being made a captive,
as well as in the storm at sea; and she remained with them
till the day appointed for her nuptials. However, Cymon and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
friends had their lives granted them (though Pasimunda used all
his endeavours to the contrary) for the favour shewed to the Rhodians
the day before; but they were sentenced to perpetual imprisonment,
where they remained sorrowfully enough, as they had
no hopes of obtaining their liberty. Now whilst Pasimunda was
making preparation for his nuptials, fortune, as if she had repented
the injury done to Cymon, produced a new circumstance for
his deliverance. Pasimunda had a brother, beneath him in years,
but not in virtue, called Ormisda, who had been long talked of as
about to marry a beautiful lady of that city, called Cassandra,
whom Lysimachus was also in love with, and had for some time
been prevented marrying her, by diverse unlucky accidents. Now
as Pasimunda was to celebrate his own nuptials with great state
and feasting, he supposed it would save a great deal of expence
and trouble, if his brother was to marry at the same time. He
consequently proposed the thing again to Cassandra's friends, and
soon brought it to a conclusion; when it was agreed by all parties,
that the same day that Pasimunda brought home Ephigenia, Ormisda
should bring home Cassandra. This was very grating to
Lysimachus, who saw himself now deprived of the hope which he
had hitherto entertained of marrying her himself; but he was wise
enough to conceal it, contriving a way to prevent its taking effect
if possible; none however appeared, but that of taking her away
by force. This seemed easy enough on account of his office; still
he thought it not so reputable as if he had borne no office at all
at that time; but in short, after a long debate with himself, honour
gave way to love, and he resolved, happen what would, to
bear away Cassandra. Thinking then what companions he should
make choice of for this enterprise, as well as the means that were
to be taken, he soon called Cymon to mind, whom he had in custody,
as also his companions; and thinking he could have nobody
better to assist him, nor one more trusty and faithful on that occasion
than Cymon, the next night he had him privately into his
chamber, where he spoke to him in this manner:&mdash;"Cymon, as
the gods are the best and most liberal givers of all things to mankind,
so are they also the ablest judges of our several virtues and
merits: such then as they find to be firm and constant in every
respect, them do they make worthy of the greatest things. Now
concerning your worth and valour, they are willing to have a
more certain trial of both, than it was possible for you to shew
within the scanty limits of your father's house, whom I know to
be a person of the greatest distinction; for first then, by the
pungent force of love, as I am informed, have they, from a mere
insensible creature, made a man of you; and afterwards by adverse
fortune, and now by a miserable imprisonment, are they willing
to see if your soul be changed from what it was, when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
appeared flushed so lately with the prize you had won. If that
continues the same, I can propose nothing so agreeable to you, as
what I am now going to offer; which, that you may resume your
former might and valour, I shall immediately disclose. Pasimunda,
overjoyed with your disappointment, and a zealous promoter, as
far as in him lay, of your being put to death, is now about to celebrate
his marriage with your Ephigenia, that he may enjoy that
blessing, which fortune, when she was favourable, first put into your
power, and afterwards snatched away from you; but how this
must afflict you, I can easily suppose by myself, who am like to
undergo the same injury, and at the same time, with regard to my
mistress Cassandra, who is to be married then to his brother Ormisda.
Now I see no remedy for either of us, but what consists
in our own resolution, and the strength of our arms: it will be
necessary, therefore, to make our way with our swords, for each
of us to gain his lady: if then you value (I will not say your liberty,
because that without her would be of little weight with
you; but, I say, if you value) your mistress, you need only follow
me, and fortune has put her into your hands." These words
spoke comfort to the drooping soul of Cymon, who immediately
replied, "Lysimachus, you could never have a more stout, nor a
more trusty friend for such an enterprize than myself, if it be as
you seem to promise: tell me then what you would have me do,
and you shall see me put it nobly into execution." Lysimachus
made answer, "Three days hence the ladies are to be brought
home to their espoused husbands, when you, with your friends and
myself, with some people whom I can confide in, will go armed in
the evening, and enter their house whilst they are in the midst of
their mirth, where we will seize on the two brides, and carry them
away to a ship which I have secretly provided, killing all that shall
presume to oppose us." This scheme was entirely to Cymon's
good liking, and he waited quietly till the time appointed. The
wedding-day being now come, and every part of their house full of
mirth and feasting, Lysimachus, after giving the necessary orders
at the time fixed, divided Cymon and his companions with his own
friends into three parties, and putting arms under their several
cloaks, and animating them boldly to pursue what they had undertaken,
he sent one party to the haven to secure their escape,
and with the other two they went to Pasimunda's house; one they
stationed at the gate, to prevent any persons shutting them up in
the house; whilst he, along with Cymon, went up stairs with the
remaining part.&mdash;Coming then into the dining-room, where the
two brides, with many other ladies, were seated orderly at supper,
they advanced up to them, and throwing down all the tables, each
seized his lady, and giving them into the arms of their followers,
ordered them to carry them away to their ship. The brides, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
well as the other ladies and the servants, cried out so much, that
immediately there was a great tumult. In the mean time, Cymon
and Lysimachus, with their followers, all drew their swords, and
came down stairs again without any opposition, till they met with
Pasimunda, having in his hand a great club, whom the noise had
drawn thither, when Cymon, at one stroke, laid him dead at his
feet, and whilst Ormisda was running to his assistance, he was
likewise killed by Cymon; many others also of their friends, who
came to their relief, were wounded and beaten back. Leaving
the house then all full of blood and confusion, they joined parties,
and went directly on to their ship with their booty, without the
least hindrance whatever; when putting the ladies on board, and
they with all their friends following them, the shore was soon filled
with crowds of people, who came to rescue them, upon which
they plied their oars, and sailed joyfully away for Crete. There
they were cheerfully received by all their friends and relations,
when they espoused their ladies, and were well pleased with their
several prizes. This occasioned great quarrels afterwards between
the two islands of Cyprus and Rhodes. At length, by the interposition
of friends, every thing was amicably adjusted, and then
Cymon returned along with Ephigenia to Cyprus, and Lysimachus
in like manner carried Cassandra back to Rhodes, where
they lived very happily to the end of their days.</p>

1671, he was sent to the Mediterranean with a squadron, to chastise
the Algerines. He found seven vessels belonging to these
pirates, lying in the bay of Bugia, covered by the fire of a castle
and forts, and defended by a boom, drawn across the entrance of
the bay, made of yards, top-masts, and cables, buoyed up by casks.
Nevertheless, Sir Edward bore into the bay, silenced the forts, and,
having broken the boom with his pinnaces, sent in a fire-ship, which
effectually destroyed the Algerine squadron; a blow which was
long remembered by these piratical states.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Etherege has been pleased to confirm our author's opinion of
the German jollity, and his own inclination to softer pleasures, by
the following passage of a letter to the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p>"I find that to this day, they (<em>i.e.</em> the Germans) make good
the observation that Tacitus made of their ancestors; I mean,
that their affairs (let them be never so serious and pressing) never
put a stop to good eating and drinking, and that they debate their
weightiest negociations over their cups.</p>

<p>"'Tis true, they carry this humour by much too far for one of
my complexion; for which reason I decline appearing among
them, but when my master's concerns make it necessary for me to
come to their assemblies: They are, indeed, a free-hearted open
sort of gentlemen that compose the Diet, without reserve, affectation,
and artifice; but they are such unmerciful plyers of the
bottle, so wholly given up to what our sots call good-fellowship,
that 'tis as great a constraint upon my nature to sit out a night's
entertainment with them, as it would be to hear half a score
long-winded Presbyterian divines cant successively one after
another.</p>

<p>"To unbosom myself frankly and freely to your grace, I always
looked upon drunkenness to be an unpardonable crime in
a young fellow, who, without any of these foreign helps, has
fire enough in his veins to enable him to do justice to Cælia
whenever she demands a tribute from him. In a middle-aged
man, I consider the bottle only as subservient to the nobler pleasures
of love; and he that would suffer himself to be so far infatuated
by it, as to neglect the pursuit of a more agreeable game,
I think deserves no quarter from the ladies: In old age, indeed,
when it is convenient very often to forget and even steal from ourselves,
I am of opinion, that a little drunkenness, discreetly used,
may as well contribute to our health of body as tranquillity of soul.</p>

<p>"Thus I have given your grace a short system of my morals
and belief in these affairs. But the gentlemen of this country go
upon a quite different scheme of pleasure; the best furniture of
their parlours, instead of innocent china, are tall overgrown rummers;
and they take more care to enlarge their cellars, than their
patrimonial estates. In short, drinking is the hereditary sin of
this country; and that hero of a deputy here, that can demolish,
at one sitting, the rest of his brother envoys, is mentioned with as
much applause as the Duke of Lorain for his noble exploits against
the Turks, and may claim a statue, erected at the public expence,
in any town in Germany.</p>

<p>"Judge, then, my lord, whether a person of my sober principles,
and one that only uses wine (as the wiser sort of Roman Catholics
do images,) to raise up my imagination to something more
exalted, and not to terminate my worship upon it, must not be reduced
to very mortifying circumstances in this place; where I
cannot pretend to enjoy conversation, without practising that vice
that directly ruins it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> This is the only mention that our author makes of the "Rehearsal"
in poetry: In prose he twice notices that satirical farce
with some contempt. The length of time which the Duke spent
upon it, or at least which elapsed between the first concoction and
the representation, is mentioned by Duke in his character of Villerius:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">But with play-houses, wars, immortal wars,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He waged, and ten years rage produced a farce.</span><br />
<div class="bigbrace">}</div>
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As many rolling years he did employ,</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And hands almost as many, to destroy</span><br />
  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Heroic rhyme, as Greece to ruin Troy.</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Once more, says fame, for battle he prepares,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And threatens rhymers with a second farce;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But if as long for this as that we stay,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">He'll finish Cliveden sooner than his play.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last line alludes to the magnificent structure at Cliveden,
which Buckingham planned, but never completed. Another satirist
has the same idea:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <span class="i0"><span class="smallbrace">{&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I come to his farce, which must needs well be done,</span><br />

His fate is an instance, among a thousand, of the disadvantage sustained
by an inferior genius, who enters into collision with one of supereminent
talents. It is the combat of a gun-boat with a frigate; and many an author
has been run down in such an encounter, who, had he avoided it, might have
still enjoyed a fair portion of literary reputation. The apologue of the iron
and earthen pot contains a moral applicable to such circumstances.</p></div>

thus describes him: "This celebrated comedian was of the middle size,
his voice clear and audible, his natural countenance grave
and sober; but the moment he spoke, the settled seriousness of
his features was utterly discharged, and a dry, drolling, or laughing
levity, took such full possession of him, that I can only refer
the idea of him to your imagination. In some of his low characters,
that became it, he had a shuffling shamble in his gait, with
so contented an ignorance in his aspect, and an aukward absurdity
in his gesture, that, had you not known him, you could not
have believed, that naturally he could have had a grain of common
sense." Our author insinuates, that the audience had been
so accustomed to the presence of this facetious actor, that they
could not tolerate a play where his low humour was excluded.</p></div>

Double Dealer," and his own tragi-comedy of "Love Triumphant." It is
addressed to Mr Walsh, and runs thus:</p>

<p>"Congreve's 'Double Dealer' is much censured by the greater part of the
town, and is defended only by the best judges, who, you know, are commonly
the fewest. Yet it gains ground daily, and has already been acted eight
times. The women think he has exposed &mdash;&mdash;; and the gentlemen
are offended with him for the discovery of their follies, and the way of their
intrigue under the notions of friendship to their ladies' husbands.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you discover not your own opinion concerning my irregular
use of tragi-comedy, in my <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">doppia favola</i>. I will never defend that practice,
for I know it distracts the hearers; but know withal, that it has hitherto
pleased them for the sake of variety, and for the particular taste which they
have to low comedy."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> "The first that was acted was Mr Congreve's, called 'The Double Dealer.'
It has fared with that play, as it generally does with beauties officiously
cried up; the mighty expectation which was raised of it made it sink, even
beneath its own merit. The character of the Double Dealer is artfully
writ; but the action being but single, and confined within the rules of true
comedy, it could not please the generality of our audience, who relish nothing
but variety, and think any thing dull and heavy which does not border
upon farce. The critics were severe upon this play, which gave the author
occasion to lash them in his epistle dedicatory, in so defying or hectoring a
style, that it was counted rude even by his best friends; so that 'tis generally
thought he has done his business, and lost himself; a thing he owes to Mr
Dryden's treacherous friendship, who, being jealous of the applause he had
got by his 'Old Bachelor,' deluded him into a foolish imitation of his own
way of writing angry prefaces."&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Malone's</span> <cite>History of the English Stage,

posts of poet-laureat, and royal historiographer, died in 1692: was
succeeded in his office of laureat by Nahum Tate, and in that of
historiographer by Thomas Rymer. Our author was at present on bad terms
with Rymer; to whom, not to Tate, he applies the sarcastic title of Tom
the Second. Yet his old co-adjutor, Nahum, is probably included in the
warning, that they should not mistake the Earl of Dorset's charity for
the recompense of their own merit. We have often remarked, that the Earl
of Dorset, although, as lord-chamberlain, he was obliged to dispose of
Dryden's offices to persons less politically obnoxious, bestowed at the
same time such marks of generosity on the abdicated laureat, that
Dryden, here, and elsewhere, honours him with the title of "his patron."
For the quarrel between Rymer and Dryden, see the Introduction to the
"Translations from Ovid's Metamorphoses," Vol. XII. p. 46. Rymer was an
useful antiquary, as his edition of the <cite>F&#339;dera</cite> bears witness; but he
was a miserable critic, and a worse poet. His tragedy of "Edgar" is
probably alluded to in the Epistle as one of the productions of his
reign. It was printed in 1678; but appeared under the new title of "<cite>The
English Monarch</cite>," in 1691.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> These sarcasms are levelled at the players; one of whom,
George Powel, took it upon him to retort in the following very
singular strain of effrontery, which Mr Malone transfers from the
preface of a tragedy; called "The Fatal Discovery, or Love in
Ruins," published in 4to, 1698.</p>

<p>"Here I am afraid he makes but a coarse compliment, when
this great wit, with his treacherous memory, forgets, that he had
given away his laurels upon record twice before, viz. once to Mr
Congreve, and another time to Mr Southerne. Pr'ythee, old &#338;dipus,
expound this mystery! Dost thou set up thy transubstantiation
miracle in the donation of thy idol bays, that thou hast
them fresh, new, and whole, to give them three times over?</p>

<p>"For the most mortal stroke at us, he charges us with downright
<em>murdering of plays, which we call reviving</em>. I will not derogate
from the merit of those senior actors of both sexes, of the
other house, that shine in their several perfections, in whose lavish
praises he is so highly transported; but, at the same time, he
makes himself but an arbitrary judge on our side, to condemn unheard,
and that under no less a conviction than murder, when I
cannot learn, for a fair judgment upon us, that his reverend
crutches have ever brought him within our doors since the division
of the companies [1695]. 'Tis true, I think, we have revived
some pieces of Dryden, as his "Sebastian," "Maiden Queen,"
"Marriage A-la-Mode," "King Arthur," &amp;c. But here let us
be tried by a Christian jury, the audience, and not receive the
bow-string from his Mahometan Grand Signiorship. 'Tis true,
his more particular pique against us, as he has declared himself, is
in relation to our reviving his "Almanzor." There, indeed, he
has reason to be angry for our waking that sleepy dowdy, and
exposing his nonsense, not ours; and if that dish did not please
him, we have a Scotch proverb for our justification, viz. <em>'twas rotten
roasted, because</em>, &amp;c. and the world must expect, 'twas very
hard crutching up what Hart and Mohun before us could not
prop. I confess, he is a little severe, when he will allow our best
performance to bear no better fruit than a crab vintage. Indeed,
if we young actors spoke but half as sourly as his old gall scribbles,
we should be crab all over."</p></div>

had lost by application to this work, is owing, next to God's mercy,
to the skill and care of Dr Guibbons and Dr Hobbs, the two
ornaments of their profession, which I can only pay by this acknowledgment."

under the same name of Maurus. See Vol. VIII. p. 442, and also
the Postscript to Virgil, where Dryden acknowledges his obligations
to the Faculty, and adds, in allusion to Blackmore, that
"the only one of them, who endeavoured to defame him, had it
not in his power."</p></div>

author classes together "one Milbourne and one Blackmore."
The former was a clergyman, and beneficed at Yarmouth. Dryden,
in the preface just quoted, insinuates, that he lost his living
for writing libels on his parishioners. These passing strokes of satire
in the text are amply merited by the virulence of Milbourne's
attack, not only on our author's poetry, but on his person, and
principles political and religious. See a note on the preface to
the "Fables," near the end.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> Sir Samuel Garth, the ingenious author of the "Dispensary."
Although this celebrated wit and physician differed widely from
Dryden in politics, being a violent Whig, they seem, nevertheless,
to have lived in the most intimate terms. Dryden contributed
to Garth's translation of the "Metamorphoses;" and Sir
Samuel had the honour to superintend the funeral of our poet,
and to pronounce a Latin oration upon that occasion. Garth's
generosity, here celebrated, consisted in maintaining a Dispensary
for issuing advice and medicines gratis to the poor. This was
highly disapproved of by the more selfish of his brethren, and
their disputes led to Sir Samuel's humorous poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> A very bloody war had been recently concluded by the peace
of Ryswick, in 1697. But the country party in Parliament entertained
violent suspicions, that King William, whose continental
connections they dreaded, intended a speedy renewal of the contest
with France. Hence they were jealous of every attempt to
maintain any military force; so that, in 1699, William saw himself
compelled, not only to disband the standing army, but to dismiss
his faithful and favourite Dutch guards. The subsequent
lines point obliquely at these measures, which were now matter of
public discussion. Dryden's cousin joined in them with many of
the Whigs, who were attached to what was called the country-party.
As for the poet, his jacobitical principles assented to every
thing which could embarrass King William. But, for the reasons
which he has assigned in his letter to Lord Montague, our
author leaves his opinion concerning the disbanding of the army
to be inferred from his panegyric on the navy, and his declamation
against the renewal of the war.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> Our poet had originally accompanied his praises of the British
soldiers with some aspersions on the cowardice of the Dutch,
their allies. These he omitted at his cousin's desire, who deemed
them disrespectful to King William. In short, he complains he had
corrected his verses so far, that he feared he had purged the spirit
out of them; as Bushby used to whip a boy so long, till he made
him a confirmed blockhead.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> Sir Robert Bevile, maternal grandfather to John Driden of Chesterton,
seems to have been imprisoned for resisting some of Charles
I.'s illegal attempts to raise supplies without the authority of parliament.
Perhaps our author now viewed his opposition to the royal
will as more excusable than he would have thought it in the reigns
of Charles II. or of James II. It is thought, that the hard usage
which Sir Robert Bevile met on this score, decided our poet's uncle,
his son-in-law, in his violent attachment to Cromwell.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> The reader will perhaps doubt, whether Mr Dryden's account
of his cousin Chesterton's accomplishments as a justice of peace,
fox-hunter, and knight of the shire, even including his prudent
abstinence from matrimony, were quite sufficient to justify this

their figures represent those on an Indian paper. It seems long
before it was known in England; for so late as 1634, Sir John
Harrington thought it necessary to give the following explanation,
in the advertisement to his translation of <cite>Orlando Furioso</cite>.</p>

<p>"The use of the picture is evident;&mdash;that, having read over the
book, they may read it as it were again in the very picture; and
one thing is to be noted, which every one haply will not observe,
namely, the perspective in every figure. For the personages of
men, the shapes of horses, and such like, are made large at the
bottom, and lesser upward, as if you were to behold all the same
in a plain, that which is nearest seems greatest, and the farthest
shews smallest, which is the chief art in picture."</p></div>

and afterwards in that of the Chandos family. Twelve
engravings were executed from this painting, which, however, the
ingenious Mr Stevens, and other commentators on Shakespeare, pronounced
a forgery. The copy presented by Kneller to Dryden, is in
the collection of Earl Fitzwilliam, at Wentworth-house; and may
claim that veneration, from having been the object of our author's
respect and enthusiasm, which has been denied to its original, as a
genuine portrait of Shakespeare. It is not, however, an admitted
point, that the Chandos picture is a forgery: the contrary has
been keenly maintained; and Mr Malone's opinion has given
weight to those who have espoused its defence.</p></div>

to fame, he sacrificed twenty to lucre; and he met with customers
of so little judgment, that they were fond of being painted by a

for preferring the lucrative, though less honourable, line of portrait
painting. "Painters of history," said he, "make the dead

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Dryden's opinion concerning the harshness of Oldham's numbers,
was not unanimously subscribed to by contemporary authors.
In the "Historical Dictionary," 1694, Oldham is termed, "a
pithy, sententious, elegant, and smooth writer:" and Winstanley
says, that none can read his works without admiration; "so pithy
his strains, so sententious his expression, so elegant his oratory, so
swimming his language, so smooth his lines." Tom Brown goes
the length to impute our author's qualification of his praise of
Oldham to the malignant spirit of envy: "'Tis your own way,
Mr Bayes, as you may remember in your verses upon Mr Oldham,
where you tell the world that he was a very fine, ingenious gentleman,
but still did not understand the cadence of the English
tongue."&mdash;<cite>Reasons for Mr Bayes' changing his Religion</cite>, Part II.
p. 33.</p>

<p>But this only proves, that Tom Brown and Mr Winstanley were
deficient in poetical ear; for Oldham's satires, though full of vehemence
and impressive expression, are, in diction, not much
more harmonious than those of Hall or of Donne. The reader
may take the following celebrated passage on the life of a nobleman's
chaplain, as illustrating both the merits and defects of his
poetry:</p>

<cite>Orinda</cite>, was the daughter of Mr Fowler, a citizen of London.
Aubrey, the most credulous of mankind, tells us, in MS. Memoirs
of her life, that she read through the Bible before she was four
years old, and would take sermons verbatim by the time she was
ten. She married a decent respectable country gentleman, called
Wogan; a name which, when it occurred in her extensive literary
correspondence, she exchanged for the fantastic appellation of
<cite>Antenor</cite>. She maintained a literary intercourse for many years
with bishops, earls, and wits, the main object of which was the
management and extrication of her husband's affairs. But whether
because the correspondents of Orinda were slack in attending
to her requests in her husband's favour, or whether because
a learned lady is a bad manager of sublunary concerns, Antenor's
circumstances became embarrassed, notwithstanding all
Orinda's exertions, and the fair solicitor was obliged to retreat
with him into Cardiganshire. Returning from this seclusion to
London, in 1664, she was seized with the small-pox, which carried
her off in the 33d year of her age.</p>

<p>Her poems and translations were collected into a folio after her
death, which bears the title of "Poems by the most deservedly
admired Mrs Katherine Philips, the matchless <span class="smcap">Orinda</span>. London,
1667."&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Ballard's</span> <cite>Memoirs of Learned Ladies</cite>, p. 287.</p>

  <span class="i0">Which struck a lustre through her outward skin,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">That did her lips and cheeks with roses dye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Advanced her height, and sparkled in her eye:</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Nor did her sex at all obstruct her fame,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">But higher 'mong the stars it fixed her name;</span><br />

by Dryden. "He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires,
but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign;
and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with the speculations
of philosophy, where he should engage their hearts, and entertain
them with the softness of love." Elizabeth Drury was the
daughter of Sir Robert Drury, with whom Donne went to Paris.
Donne celebrated her merit, and lamented her death in elegies,
entitled, "The Anatomy of the World, wherein, by occasion of
the untimely Death of Mrs Elizabeth Drury, the frailty and the
decay of this whole World is represented." These elegiac verses
are divided into two anniversaries, through which the editor attempted
in vain to struggle in search of the acknowledgment

as the "Orpheus Britannicus" is a scarce book.&mdash;"To the Honourable Lady
Howard. Madam, Were it in the power of music to abate those strong impressions
of grief which have continued upon me ever since the loss of my
dear lamented husband, there are few, I believe, who are furnished with
larger or better supplies of comfort from this science, than he has left me in
his own compositions, and in the satisfaction I find, that they are not more
valued by me, who must own myself fond to a partiality of all that was his,
than by those who are no less judges than patrons of his performances. I
find, madam, I have already said enough to justify the presumption of this
application to your ladyship, who have added both these characters to the
many excellent qualities which make you the admiration of all that know
you.</p>

<p>"Your ladyship's extraordinary skill in music, beyond most of either sex,
and your great goodness to that dear person, whom you have sometimes
been pleased to honour with the title of your master, makes it hard for me to
judge whether he contributed more to the vast improvements you have made
in that science, or your ladyship to the reputation he gained in the profession
of it: For I have often heard him say, that, as several of his best compositions
were originally designed for your ladyship's entertainment, so the
pains he bestowed in fitting them for your ear, were abundantly rewarded by
the satisfaction he has received from your approbation and admirable performance
of them, which has best recommended both them and their author
to all that have had the happiness of hearing them from your ladyship.</p>

<p>"Another great advantage, to which my husband has often imputed the success
of his labours, and which may best plead for your ladyship's favourable
acceptance of this collection, has been the great justness both of thought and
numbers which he found in the poetry of our most refined writers, and among
them, of that honourable gentleman, who has the dearest and most deserved
relation to yourself, and whose excellent compositions were the subject of
his last and best performances in music.</p>

<p>"Thus, madam, your ladyship has every way the justest titles to the patronage
of this book; the publication of which, under the auspicious influence of
your name, is the best (I had almost said the only) means I have left, of testifying
to the world, my desire to pay the last honours to its dear author,
your ladyship having generously prevented my intended performance of the
duty I owe to his ashes, by erecting a fair monument over them, and gracing
it with an inscription which may perpetuate both the marble and his memory.</p>

<p>"Your generosity, which was too large to be confined either to his life or
person, has also extended itself to his posterity, on whom your ladyship has
been pleased to entail your favours, which must, with all gratitude, be acknowledged
as the most valuable part of their inheritance, both by them,
and your ladyship's most obliged, and most humble servant,</p>

Fairbone fell, and of the revenge to which the author alludes, is
taken from the Gazette of the time:</p>

<p>"<em>Malaga, November 12.</em>&mdash;Three days since arrived here a
small vessel, which stopped at Tangier, from whence we have letters,
which give an account, that on the 2d instant, Sir Palmes
Fairbone, the governor, as he was riding without the town with a
party of horse, to observe what the Moors were doing, was shot
by one of them, and, being mortally wounded, fell from his horse:
That the Moors had intrenched themselves near the town, whereupon
the whole garrison, consisting of 4000 horse and foot, sallied
out upon them, commanded by Colonel Sackville: That they
marched out in the night; but were quickly discovered by the
Moors' sentinels, who immediately gave the alarm: That in the
morning there was a very sharp engagement, which lasted six
hours; and then the Moors, who were above 20,000, fled, and
were pursued by the English, who killed above 1500 of them, took
four of their greatest guns, and filled up all the trenches, and then
retired to the town with several prisoners, having obtained a most
signal victory, wherein the Spanish horse behaved themselves as
well as men could do. The day the said vessel came from Tangier,
which was the 7th, they heard much shooting, which makes
us believe there has been a second engagement.</p>

<p>"<em>Malaga, November 12</em>, (1680.)&mdash;By a vessel arrived from
Tangier, we have advice, that on Wednesday last all the force of
that garrison took the field, and gave battle to about 30,000 Moors.
The Spanish horse and 800 seamen marched in the van, the English
horse with the main body. The fight lasted near six hours,
with the slaughter of between 1500 and 2000 Moors, and of 150
of the garrison: That the Moors fled; the English kept the field;
took six pieces of cannon, and six colours. Every soldier that
brought in a flag had thirty guineas given to him; and every one
that took a Moor prisoner had him for his encouragement. There
were about twenty taken; and 300 bodies of Moors were dragged
together in one heap, and as many heads in another pile. But the
great misfortune was, that the Saturday before, the governor, as
he was walking under the walls, received a mortal wound, which
the Spanish horse so bravely resented, that immediately, without
command, they mounted and charged the Moors with that courage,
that they killed many of them, with the loss of seven or eight
of themselves. Before this action, the Moors were so near the
walls of the town, that with hand-slings they pelted our soldiers
with stones."&mdash;<cite>London Gazette</cite>, No. 1567.</p>

<p>"<em>Whitehall, November 27.</em>&mdash;Yesterday morning arrived here
Lieutenant-colonel Talmash from Tangier, and gave his Majesty
an account, that Colonel Sackville, who has now the chief command,
(Sir Palmes Fairbone, the late governor, having been unfortunately
wounded with a musket shot on the 24th past, of which
he died three days after,) finding that the Moors began to approach
very near to Pole-fort, and were preparing to mine it, called a
council of war, and, pursuant to what was there resolved, marched
out on the 27th with 1500 foot and 300 horse, and fell upon the
Moors with so much bravery, that, notwithstanding the inequality
of their number, and the stout resistance they made, they beat
them out of the trenches, and from their several lines, and gave
them a total defeat; pursuing them a mile into the country, with
a great slaughter of them; filling up their trenches, and levelling
their lines, and taking two pieces of cannon, five colours, and several
prisoners; though with the loss of many officers and private
soldiers killed and wounded on our side."&mdash;<cite>Ibidem</cite>, No. 1569.</p></div>

Earl of Ossory, and grandson to the great Duke of Ormond, to
whose honours he succeeded in 1688. He was first married to
Lady Anne Hyde, daughter of Lawrence Earl of Rochester; and,
upon her death, to Lady Mary Somerset, second daughter of the
Duke of Beaufort. The Duke of Ormond was favoured by King
William, but attained still higher power and influence during the
reign of Queen Anne, especially in her later years, when he entered
into all the views of her Tory administration. Upon the accession
of George I, he was impeached of high treason, and consulted his
safety by flying abroad. He died in Spain in 1746.</p>

the story of Griselda in his "Decameron," which was written about
1160, and Petrarch did not translate it till 1173, the year of his
death, when he executed a Latin version of it. Even then, he mentions
it as a traditional tale, which he had often heard with pleasure.
The original edition of the story is difficult to discover.
Noguier, in his "Histoire de Tholouse," affirms, that this mirror
of female patience actually existed about the year 1103, and Le
Grand lays claim to her history as originally a French fabliau. It
seems certain, at least, that it was not invented by Petrarch, although
Chaucer quotes his authority, probably that he might introduce
a panegyric on his departed friend:</p>

the "Philostrato," contains the original of Chaucer's "Troilus
and Creseide." But Chaucer himself calls his original "Lollius"
and the Book "Trophe;" and I think, with Mr Godwin, that we
are not hastily to conclude that this was an invention, to disguise
his pillaging Boccacio, when we consider the probability of the
work, which served as their common original, being lost in the
course of so many ages. See this question discussed in Godwin's
"Life of Chaucer," Vol. I. p 263.</p></div>

treating them; but, in both cases, Chaucer was contented to adopt
the story of some more ancient tale-teller. The "Wife of Bath's
Tale" is imitated from the "Florent" in Gower, and that probably
from the work of an older minstrel. Or Chaucer may have copied
the old tale called the "Marriage of Sir Gawain," which is probably
the corrupted fragment of a metrical romance. The apologue
of "The Cock and the Fox," is to be found in the "Fables" of
Marie of France, who seems to have lived in the reign of Henry III.

1602. The preface contains the passage which Dryden alludes to:
"And for his (Chaucer's) verses, although, in divers places, they seem
to us to stand of unequal measures, yet a skilful reader, who can
scan them in their nature, shall find it otherwise. And if a verse,
here and there, fal out a syllable shorter or longer than another,
I rather aret it to the negligence and rape of Adam Scrivener,
(that I may speake as Chaucer doth) than to any unconning or
oversight in the author: For how fearful he was to have his
works miswritten, or his verse mismeasured, may appeare in the
end of his fift booke of "Troylus and Creseide," where he writeth
thus:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"And for there is so great diversitie</span><br />
  <span class="i0">In English, and in writing of our tongue,</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Ne thee mismetre for defaut of tongue."</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By his hasty and inconsiderate contradiction of honest Speght's
panegyric, Dryden has exposed himself to be censured for pronouncing
rashly upon a subject with which he was but imperfectly
acquainted. The learned Tyrwhitt has supported Speght's
position with equal pains and success, and plainly proves, that
the apparent inequalities of the rhyme of Chaucer, arise chiefly
from the change in pronunciation since his time, particularly
from a number of words being now pronounced as one syllable,
which in those days were prolonged into two, or as two syllables
which were anciently three. These researches, in the words of Ellis,
"have proved what Dryden denied, viz. that Chaucer's versification,
wherever his genuine text is preserved, was uniformly correct,
although the harmony of his lines has, in many cases, been obliterated
by the changes that have taken place in the mode of accenting
our language."&mdash;<cite>Specimens of the Early English Poets</cite>, Vol. I.

by his grandson, and probably favoured by Henry IV., the son of
his original patron; but if Dryden meant, that he held, during
these reigns, the precise office of poet-laureat, once enjoyed by
himself, it is difficult to suppose that any such had existence.</p></div>

place under the management of John of Northampton, commonly
called John Cumbertown. Chaucer was forced to fly to Holland,
in consequence of having some concern in that insurrection, and
on his return he was arrested and committed to the Tower. Katherine
Swynford, mistress, and at length wife, to John of Gaunt,
was sister of Philippa Rouet, wife of the poet.</p></div>

In speaking of it, Dryden inadvertently confounds it with
the work of Robert Langland, a secular priest, well known to collectors
by the title of "Pierce Plowman's Visions." Both poems
contain a bitter satire against the clergy; but that which has been
falsely ascribed to Chaucer, is expressly written in favour of Wickliffe's
doctrine. Dryden probably was sufficiently ready to adopt
any authority which seemed to countenance severity against the
churchmen,&mdash;a subject upon which he always flies into declamation.</p></div>

entitled epic poems, published in 1695 and 1697. In the preface
to the first, occurred the following severe attack upon Dryden,
which is inserted by Mr Malone as illustrative of the passage in
the text.</p>

<p>"Some of these poets, to excuse their guilt, allege for themselves,
that the degeneracy of the age makes their lewd way of
writing necessary. They pretend, the auditors will not be pleased,
unless they are thus entertained from the stage; and to please,
they say, is the chief business of the poet. But this is by no
means a just apology. It is not true, as was said before, that the
poet's chief business is to please: his chief business is to instruct,
to make mankind wiser and better; and, in order to this, his care
should be to please and entertain the audience, with all the wit and
art he is master of. Aristotle and Horace, and all their critics
and commentators, all men of wit and sense, agree, that this is the
end of poetry. But they say, it is their profession to write for the
stage; and that poets must starve, if they will not, in this way,
humour the audience; the theatre will be as unfrequented as the
churches, and the poet and the parson equally neglected. Let the
poet, then, abandon his profession, and take up some honest, lawful,
calling; where, joining industry to his great wit, he may soon
get above the complaints of poverty, so common among these ingenious
men, and lie under no necessity of prostituting his wit, to
any such vile purposes as are here censured. This will be a
course of life more profitable and honourable to himself, and more
useful to others. And there are, among these writers, <em>some, who
think they might have risen to the highest dignities, in other professions,
had they employed their wit in those ways</em>. It is a mighty
dishonour and reproach to any man that is capable of being useful
to the world, in any <em>liberal and virtuous</em> profession, <em>to lavish
out his life and wit, in propagating vice and corruption of manners</em>,
and in battering, from the stage, the strongest entrenchments, and
best works, of religion and virtue. Whoever makes this his choice,
when the other was in his power, may he go off the stage unpitied,
<em>complaining of neglect and poverty, the just punishments of his irreligion
and folly</em>."</p></div>

to compel them to a general action. But the plunder of the
baggage occasioned so much delay, that the van of the Prince of
Orange's army had time to rejoin the centre; and, though the
French maintained the action with great vigour, they were, in the
end, compelled to leave the Confederates in possession of the field
of battle. This battle was fought 11th August, 1674.</p></div>

when a challenger, in a cause of treason, had died before the day
of combat, a court of chivalry appointed his dead body to be
brought into the lists, completely armed, and adjudged that the
defendant should be held conqueror, if he could throw it over the
bars. But the corpse and arms being weighty, the sun set before
he could accomplish this, and he was condemned for treason as
conquered in the trial by combat. See Sir David Lindsay on
Heraldry, MS. Advocates' Library.</p></div>

the modern fashions of female dress; and as it was necessary, in the
single combat, that each warrior should be equally armed, it was
a matter of no small nicety, to ascertain exactly, what weapons, offensive
and defensive, should be allowed to them. But in general
tournaments, each knight seems to have used the arms which
pleased him best; subject always to such general regulations as
were laid down by the judges, for lessening the danger of these military
games. There is a long enumeration of various kinds of armour,
in the romance of "Clariodus and Meliadus."</p></div>

of the old English. Chaucer talks of <em>boughs</em>, not of <em>bows</em>; and
says simply,</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">And tho that barin bowes in their hand;</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Of the precious lawrier so notable.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>

<p>This refers to the description of the knights at their entrance,
which Dryden has rightly rendered:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">Some in their hands, besides the lance and shield,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">The bows of woodbine, or of hawthorn, held;</span><br />

  <span class="i0">Of palm, of laurel, or of cerrial oak.</span><br />
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bow, though the youth trained to chivalry were taught to
use it, made no part of a knight's proper weapons. But it is curious
how Dryden, having fallen into an error, finds out a reason
for his false reading, by alleging, that the bows were borne as an
emblem of strength of arm, valour, and victory. [Since this note
was written, I observe, that the ingenious Dr Aikin has anticipated
